The array elements are structured as follows:(block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract,ton of block to process). Then I will provide you with a list of possible actions which are formatted as follows: (choice, block_number, ton_present, per unit change in NPV if selected). If choice=1, it will do extraction if choice=2 it will do processing. If processing you will receive revenue and if extraction you will have cost. Your task is to chose one action in following format: (choice,block_number,amount_you_want_to_be_operated_on) which is optimal based on maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV) over a specified number of periods.

We have possible actions: extraction for block 1-11 with 20 tons each, cost -9.09 per ton? Actually \"per unit change in NPV\" is given as -9.09 for extraction of 20? Wait earlier: first time had extraction cost -9.09 per unit? For extraction 50 tons gave -9.09 per ton. So for 20 tons, NPV change per unit is -9.09. For each action we can choose amount. We must choose one action. Should we maybe consider processing? No processing options present. Only extraction of remaining blocks. All remaining blocks are 20 tons of ore (since originally 50, 30 extraction remaining?). The block numbers 1-11 all have 20 tons left. We need to pick action that maximizes NPV? Extraction costs negative NPV, so we want minimal cost. But maybe some blocks have different ore concentration? However extraction cost per ton is constant across all blocks (-9.09). So any extraction reduces NPV by 20*9.09 = -181.8. But we might be forced to eventually extract them to get processing revenue. But no processing actions available now? Actually there is no processing action listed. Maybe later. For now, we might choose the block with lowest ore concentration to delay extraction? But extraction cost is same regardless of ore concentration? However the ore concentration may affect future processing revenue (but not present). Since processing hasn\\'t occurred yet, we can choose to delay extraction until later, but we must still pick an action this period. All extraction actions cost same, but we might choose block with lowest ore concentration to maybe later pick. But we might not have any processing option this period, so we must pick something. The objective is maximize NPV over specified periods. Without processing, extraction reduces NPV. But we must eventually extract to get revenue. But maybe we can postpone extraction to a later period when processing is available. But we don\\'t know future actions. We only have actions now. So we must pick one extraction action. Which block is best to extract now? Probably block with highest ore concentration would give higher revenue later. But extraction cost same. So we might postpone low ore blocks. So pick block with highest ore concentration among remaining: block 4 (0.67), 7 (0.72), 8 (0.71), 9 (0.68), 10 (0.75), 11 (0.74). Highest is 10 (0.75). 11 is 0.74. 7 is 0.72. 9 is 0.68.

We need to choose an action that maximizes NPV increase. We have list with choice 1 and 2. For each action, we need to compute effect? The possible actions list contains tuples: (choice, block_number, amount, delta NPV). So we just choose action with best delta. So pick action with highest delta. There is (2,10,37,82.64) positive delta. Also (1,1-11 with negative delta). So choose action (2,10,37). But check constraints: block 10 currently has 0.0 ore, 37 processing? Actually after previous extraction, block 10 ore 0.0. Wait: after we extracted 30 from block 10 ore remaining 0, but ore processed is 30? Actually block 10 has ore 0.0, 37 processing remains 37. So block 10 still has 37 processing available. In list, they propose (2,10,37,82.64) so that means process 37 units of ore from block 10. Since ore available is 0? Wait, ore was 0.0. But after extraction we set ore to 0.0. Actually ore was 0.0 after extraction. So we can't process 37 units of ore. But perhaps extraction action (1,10,30) removed 30 ore leaving 20 ore? Wait earlier block 10 had 30 ore left after extraction of 30? Wait timeline: initial block 10 ore 50, we extracted 20 earlier (choice 1, block 10, amount 20). Then we later extracted 30, so block 10 ore becomes 0? Let's check: after first extraction 20, block 10 ore left 30. Then extracted 30, ore becomes 0. So block 10 ore is 0. So cannot process. However the current mine state shows block 10 ore 0.0, processing 37. So we can't process.\\n\\nThus list says (2,10,37,82.64) but that is inconsistent.

Maybe the actions allow extraction from block 1 or 2, but the block's remaining ton is 50 for block 2? Actually block 2 has 0.0 remaining because we extracted earlier 50? Wait earlier we extracted 50 from block 2? At Time_period-3 state, block 2 has 0.0 remaining after extraction 50. So no more. So extraction of 30 from block 2 impossible.

Wait block 2's attributes: from state: in first list, second layer? Actually state lists: layer 0: block 1: 0.0 left, block 2: 0.0 left, block 3: 50 left, etc. So block 2 has 0 remaining. So cannot extract. But we could process block 2? It has 0 remaining extracted. But we could process 10 tons of block 2? But processing requires extracted material? Actually block 2 has 0 extracted, but still has 0? Wait the tuple shows 0.0 left. Means all extracted? But earlier we extracted 50 tons of block 2, so left 0. So we cannot process block 2.\\n\\nBut the action (2,2,10,75.13) indicates processing block 2, amount 10, per unit profit 75.13. But block 2 has 0 extracted?

Wait after extraction of 10 tons of block 3, 4, etc, they have remaining 10 ton to process? But processing requires extracted material. But block 2 has 0 extracted, so cannot process.\\n\\nThus the only available extraction actions produce cost. Maybe we should choose the processing action to get high profit 75.13 per ton. But is block 2 has any extracted material? Let's check block 2 state: (2, 0.0, 0.0, 30)? Actually the state shows block 2 has 0 remaining extracted. So cannot process. Wait but earlier action (2,2,10,75.13) suggests processing block 2. Maybe block 2 has 10 extracted? But block 2 remaining extracted 0. But maybe the action includes processing 10 tons of material extracted from block 2? But there's none.\\n\\nBut maybe the per unit change in NPV if selected is per unit of extracted material? For extraction cost -7.51 per ton. For processing, profit per unit 75.13. But we have to have extracted material available to process. We currently have block 2 with 0 extracted. But maybe we can process block 2's remaining extracted of 10? But it's 0. So can't.\\n\\nThus all extraction actions are cost -7.51 per ton. But we have no processing actions except block 2 which doesn't have material.\\n\\nMaybe we should skip? But rule: must pick an action. We need maximize NPV. All extraction actions cost negative. So maybe we should choose no extraction? But must pick an action. The only positive NPV action is (2,2,10,75.13). However is this processing of block 2? But block 2 has 0 extracted. So cannot process. But maybe the system allows processing of block 2 even if no extracted? That doesn't make sense. But maybe block 2 still has 0 left but can be processed? But we need to check original tuple: The action list from earlier: at Time_period-3 we had (2, 1, 30, 75.13) as a processing action for block 1. That was possible because block 1 had extracted 30 tons earlier. So processing block 1 had profit 75.13 per ton. So processing actions are only for blocks with extracted material. Thus processing actions require extracted material available. So the action list includes only (2,2,10,75.13). But block 2 has 0 extracted; but maybe earlier extraction of block 2 left 0, but maybe still has some extracted? Wait state: block 2 has 0.0 left and 30? Wait block 2 has 0 extracted. So no material. So cannot process.\\n\\nThus all remaining actions are extraction costing -7.51 each. So we have to choose one. We should pick the block with lowest cost? All same cost per ton. So choose any. Maybe pick the smallest amount to minimize loss? They all have amount 10. So all identical cost. So choose any extraction. Which yields negative NPV. But maybe we could skip processing? But we must pick an action. So choose extraction of block 3 maybe.

The state shows block 1 processed ton 0 after processing. That seems weird: processing after extraction reduces processed ton to 0? Actually after processing block 1, its processed ton becomes 0.

In state after extraction on block 1, ton_present=0, processed_ton=0. After processing block 1, ton_present=0, processed_ton=0? The state shows (1,0.61,0.0,0.0). So processed_ton 0. That seems odd.\\n\\nBut the state also shows NPV jumped from 6827.94 to 6752.81? Wait after processing block 1, NPV decreased: from 6827.94 to 6752.81? That indicates maybe processing block 1 had cost? But earlier action (2,1,30) had revenue 75.13. Actually they processed block 1 for 30 tons, adding 75.13 each? But the NPV dropped, maybe because they processed block 1 before extraction?

Let's compute new NPV: previous 6752.81 + 75.13 = 6827.94. That matches the earlier NPV after processing block 2? Wait earlier after processing block 1, NPV was 6827.94. But now after processing block 2, NPV would be 6752.81 + 75.13 = 6827.94. So yes that's same. So we should output action (2,2,10).\\n\\nBut we need to confirm the action list includes (2,2,10,75.13).

Wait earlier we had extraction cost negative NPV per unit. So choosing extraction will reduce NPV. But processing block 2 amount 20 with revenue +68.3 per unit. So processing block 2 increases NPV. We want maximize NPV. So choose processing block 2 amount 20. Also block 2 currently has 20 ton remainingnata? Actually block 2 had 30 originally. We processed 10 earlier? Wait current state: block 2 has 20 remaining after previous actions? Let\\'s examine state: In second last state block 2 had 20? Actually after processing 2 of 10, block 2 had 10 remaining. Wait track: Initially 30, processed 20? Let\\'s check: at start: block2 30. We processed 10? Actually earlier we processed 10? Let\\'s recount. Sequence: 1) processed block1 30. 2) processed block1 10? Actually we processed block2? Let\\'s list:\\n\\n- first action processed block1 30, NPV decreased to 7502? Actually processed block1 30 gave revenue +something. After that block1 fully processed. Then we processed block2 10? Wait steps: 1: processed block1 30. 2: processed block2 10? Actually sequence: After that we extracted block3 10? Wait reading sequence:\\n\\n- first step processed block1 30.\\n- second processed block2 10? Actually second step: \"choice was: 2, block_number was: 2, amount was: 10.\" That was processing block2 amount 10. After that NPV 6752.81.\\n\\nWait let\\'s reconstruct chronology:\\n\\nInitial NPV 7502.7? Wait earlier: after first extraction block3 10 we had NPV 6752.81.\\n\\nThen we had only action (2,2,10). So processed block2 amount 10. That increased NPV to 7504.12? Wait earlier after processing block2 10, NPV was 7504.12? Yes after processing block2 amount 10. Good.\\n\\nNow block2 remaining ton: initially 30. We processed 10. Now remaining 20. So processing remaining 20 gives revenue +68.3 per unit (per ton). So we should process block2 20.\\n\\nAlso there is extraction on block3 40 cost -6.83 per ton; but maybe we want to finish processing block2 and then maybe extraction block3? But each step maybe single action? Probably one action per period? The system likely chooses one action each period. So we choose the action that yields highest NPV improvement. Processing block2 gives +68.3*20 = +1366? Wait the cost per ton is given as 68.3 positive value (not negative). In earlier steps we added +68.3 per ton, we saw NPV increased from 6752.81 to 7504.12? Actually difference is 751? Wait 7504 - 6752 = 751. That suggests per ton revenue was 68.3, times 10 = 683? Wait difference 7504.12 - 6752.81 = 751.31, but action says 68.3 per ton, times 10 = 683. That seems not match. Maybe the values are total NPV change? Let\\'s check earlier step: When we processed block2 10 we had NPV 7504.12. Previous NPV was 6752.81. Difference 751.31. That implies revenue ~751.31 total. The action list says (2,2,10,75.13). That suggests total revenue? Wait earlier when we processed block2 10, we had 6752.81 and action (2,2,10,75.13). We chose that, NPV increased to 7504.12? Let\\'s compute: 6752.81 + 75.13*10 = 6752.81 + 751.3 = 7504.11. Yes that matches. So the last number is total revenue? Actually it\\'s revenue per unit? Because we multiplied by 10 and got 751.3. So revenue per ton 75.13. So 68.3 per ton? In current list it\\'s (2,2,20,68.3). So revenue per ton 68.3. So processing 20 tons gives +1366. So NPV would become 7504.12 + 1366 = 8870.12. Good.\\n\\nAlternatively we could process block2 10? Actually only action left is process block2 20.

The possible actions are all extraction actions: (1,3,40) and so on with cost per ton -6.83. We have to pick an action to maximize NPV over remaining periods? The problem statement: \"Your task is to chose one action in following format: ... which is optimal based on maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV) over a specified number of periods.\" We don\\'t have future periods defined but likely we must consider that processing gives revenue 75.13 per ton? Actually from earlier actions: processing yields 75.13 per ton. So extraction cost -6.83 per ton, processing revenue +75.13 per ton. So we should extract and then process later. But we can also process meira if available? No process options now because block 2 is already processed fully? All block 2 extraction left 0, so processing only possible on block 2? Actually block 2 has extraction amount 20 left, but we already processed 10 earlier? Wait we processed 10 of block 2 earlier. Block 2 extraction left 20. But now we processed 20? Wait current state after processing 20 at block 2, we have no extraction left at block 2. But the actions list only extraction, no processing. That means we are forced to do extraction. After extraction we can later process in future periods. But since only extraction actions available, maybe it\\'s best to extract as many as possible? But we need to consider period number. Time_period-4 now. Possibly more periods remain after this? We don\\'t know. Maybe the horizon is 4? But we are at period 4, after that we only have possible actions of extraction of remaining blocks. After period 4, likely we will process them later. To maximize NPV, we should extract all available ore to process. But extraction costs negative but small. So we should extract all possible tonnage from any block? But each extraction action may be limited by the amount of ore present. For block 3, ore left 40, so extraction 40 possible. Blocks 4-11 have ore 50 each. Should we extract all? But we might consider that after extraction, we can process those extracted ore in future period. Since processing revenue high, we should extract all. But we also may have limited processing capacity? Not specified. Probably unlimited processing. So best to extract all remaining ore across blocks. However, extraction cost is -6.83 per ton, so NPV incremental = -6.83*ton. Then processing later yields +75.13*ton. Net incremental 68.3 per ton (like earlier when block 2 extraction 20 processed gave 68.3). So we want to maximize extraction then processing. Since all extraction cost same per ton, to maximize NPV, we should extract all available ore across all blocks. But we must choose one action per period; we cannot combine. We might have multiple periods. The horizon likely small; but the problem seems to require selecting the best action now, knowing future actions will include processing. Since we cannot process now, we must extract. We want to extract the block with highest ore? All ore have same cost per ton and same processing revenue. So any block is equal in terms of NPV if we will process later. But maybe earlier extraction reduces cost? No, extraction cost per ton is same -6.83. So we might as well extract any block. Perhaps we choose block 3 extraction of 40. After extraction, ore left for processing. So answer: choice 1, block 3, amount 40.\\n\\nBut maybe we consider block 4 extraction 50, block 5 extraction 50, etc. All same. The one with minimum cost? All same -6.83. So maybe choose any.

Wait block 2\\'s ton of block to extract earlier had 0 after we processed it? Let\\'s check: In mine state time period 4过去 we saw block 2 ton to extract 0 after earlier extraction. Indeed we earlier extracted 20 units of block 2? Actually we had action: extraction of block 3 40 units (full extraction). Block 2 had ton to extract 20 (since we processed 20 units from block 2 in previous period, leaving 20 to extract). Wait after time period 4, block 2\\'s ton to extract became 0 after we extracted 20? Wait we see mine state at time period 4 after extraction of block 3 (action 1 block 3 40). It shows block 2 ton_present 0? Let\\'s inspect: The state shows block 2 ton_present 0 (since we processed 20 units earlier). Actually earlier we processed block 2 twice: first processing 20 units gave NPV 8870.15. After that we processed block 2 again? Wait we then extracted block 3 40, then had a processing action on block 2 20 units. That gave NPV 8870.15. Then we extracted block 3 40? Wait timeline:\\n\\nTime period 4: After extraction of block 3 40 units, NPV 8870.15. That state shows block 2 ton_present 0. After that we had possible actions: extraction on various blocks (tons 40 or 50) and processing on block 2 with 20 units. Wait but block 2 ton_present 0. However ton to extract for block 2 is 20? Wait after extraction of 20 units? Let\\'s review earlier timeline.\\n\\nAt time period 4 after processing block 2 amount 20, NPV 8870.15. The state shows block 2 ton_present 0, block 2 ton to extract 0? Actually we see block 2 (row 0 col1) has ton_present 0. So we cannot process block 2 anymore. But the possible actions list includes processing on block 2 amount 20? Wait earlier we had possible actions: (2, 2, 20, 68.3). But after we processed it, it should be 0? But maybe the system still lists processing action even if ton_present 0? That seems contradictory. Let\\'s examine earlier: At time period 3 after extraction of block 2 20 units, block 2 ton_present 0. In period 4, possible actions include processing block 2 with 20 units? But block 2 already processed 20 earlier? Wait earlier we had processing block 2 20 units? No earlier we processed block 2 20 units at time period 3, after extraction of block 2 20 units? Let\\'s trace:\\n\\nSequence:\\n\\n- Time period 1: extraction block 3 40 units (choice 1). After extraction, block 3 ton left 0, ton to extract 0. Block 2 ton_present 0, ton to extract 20? Wait block 2 had ton to extract 20 after previous processing? No.\\n\\nActually timeline:\\n\\n- At period 1, we did extraction of block 3 40 units? Wait initial state: block 3 ton_present 40, ton to extract 40. We chose extraction of block 3 40, which removed all extractable ton, leaving ton_present 0, ton to extract 0.\\n\\n- Then at period 2: we processed block 2 20 units? Wait after extraction of block 3, we processed block 2 20 units? Let\\'s see earlier: In time period 2, possible actions had extraction actions with amount 40 etc and processing block 2 with 20 units. The assistant chose processing block 2 with amount 20, raising NPV to 8870.15. So block 2 had ton_present 20? But state shows block 2 ton_present 0 after processing? Actually after processing block 2 20 units, the state shows block 2 ton_present 0. That matches.\\n\\nSo after time period 4 extraction of block 3 40 units, we still have block 2 ton_present 0. But the action list includes processing block 2 20 units. That\\'s weird. The ton_present is 0, so can\\'t process? Perhaps ton_present refers to ton of block to process? Actually earlier in state we had ton of block to process (ton to process). For extraction, we used \"ton of block to extract\" but for processing we use \"ton of block to process\"? The format in state: each cell: (block_id, ton_of_block_to_extract, ton_of_block_to_process). For extraction, we use ton_of_block_to_extract. For processing, we use ton_of_block_to_process.\\n\\nIn state, block 2 has ton to extract 0, ton to process 0 after earlier extraction? Wait we didn\\'t process block 2 earlier? Actually earlier we processed block 2 20 units. So block 2\\'s ton to process decreased accordingly. In state after extraction block 3 40, block 2 ton_present 0, ton to process 0. So cannot process.\\n\\nThus all possible actions are extraction of other blocks (tons 40 or 50) with negative NPV per unit (cost). So the best is not to take any action? But we must choose an action. The last possible actions list includes extraction actions with cost -6.83 per unit. Processing action: choice 2 on block 3 20 units with revenue 68.3 per unit? Wait the list: (2, 3, 20, 68.3). That is processing block 3 20 units with 68.3 per unit. Block 3 has ton_present 0 (after extraction), so cannot process. But maybe the system incorrectly shows block 3 in processing? Actually the list: (2, 3, 20, 68.3) but block 3 is fully extracted. So cannot process. So maybe we should not take any action? But we need to choose something. We must choose an action that maximizes NPV over the remaining periods. The NPV after extraction of block 3 40 is 8596.94. After we choose extraction of block 4 30 units, NPV would decrease by 6.83 *30 = 204.9 -> 8392.04? Wait current NPV 8596.94. Extraction of block 4 30 units cost 6.83 per unit, so NPV new = 8596.94 - 6.83*30 = 8596.94 - 204.9 = 8392.04. That is lower. So best is not to do any extraction? But we must do something? Maybe we should not choose any action, but the system expects an action. The instruction: \"Choose from possible actions\". We have no processing action. So we should pick extraction of block 4 30 units? But that reduces NPV. Since there is no positive action, the best we can do is the least negative extraction.\\n\\nWe must choose among the extraction actions. Each extraction of block 4 30 units reduces NPV by 6.83 per unit *30 = 204.9, as above. Similarly for other blocks: block 5,6,7,8,9,11 each have cost -6.83 per unit and ton 30. So each reduces NPV by 204.9. So they are all equivalent. If we want to minimize loss, choose any. But maybe we should not take any action and wait for next period? The system might not allow idle. But maybe we can choose no action? The instruction says \"Choose from possible actions\" only. So we must pick one.\\n\\nWe should choose extraction of block 4 30? All extraction actions cost same. So we can pick any. Maybe choose block 4 because it\\'s top row, maybe future value? But no future processing available. After extraction of block 4 30, block 4\\'s ton to extract will be 20 left? Wait initial ton to extract for block 4 is 50, we extracted 30, leaving 20. But after extraction of block 4 30 units, NPV decreases. So best is to choose extraction of block 4? But all same.\\n\\nThus answer: choice 1, block_number 4, amount 30.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 63961464480, 'load_duration': 168757852, 'prompt_eval_count': 3919, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1203882998, 'eval_count': 1945, 'eval_duration': 34141650973}\n",

We need to maximize NPV over remaining periods. We have actions: extraction options for blocks 4,5,7,8,9,11 with cost per unit? The per unit change in NPV is negative -6.21 for all. Also we have no processing actions currently because only block 3 had remaining ore, but already processed. So we must choose an extraction to reduce future costs? But extraction cost reduces NPV now, but may allow future processing revenue? However after extraction, block becomes available for processing. But we don't have processing actions listed; perhaps because only block 6 had ore left but processed already. All blocks with ore: check mine state samsung. In time_period-5: Blocks with ore:\\n\\n- Block 4: ore 50, process 33, so has 50 ore? Actually ore attribute is ore left; block 4 has ore 50. So we could process block 4 after extraction. But processing not available maybe because only when ore extracted? But we need to consider if we can process block 4 immediately? Possibly no processing action in list indicates maybe only processing actions for blocks that have ore. Actually all blocks with ore left: block 4,5,7,8,9,11,13-16,17-24,32,33. But possible actions list only includes extraction actions. So maybe processing actions only become available after extraction. So if we extract block 4, we can later process it. But we haven't seen any processing actions for those blocks. But maybe processing actions are not listed until after extraction? The list only includes extraction actions, no processing actions because perhaps we cannot process yet. But we might be able to process some blocks directly if they have ore. But block 4 had ore. But we didn't have processing action earlier because maybe only block 3 had ore left and we processed it. So why no processing actions for block 4? Because ore hasn't been extracted? Actually ore present but not extracted; processing requires ore to be extracted first? The initial state had ore for block 3 only. Others had ore but we didn't process them because we only processed block 3? Wait original list: initial actions had processing for block 3 (process 33, ore left 33). Then extraction for block 4 etc. Then process block 3 again? But processing of block 3 only appears once earlier. So processing actions available only after extraction. But for block 4, extraction cost is negative -6.21, but after extraction we can process later. But we don't know per unit change in NPV for processing of block 4. We can calculate: each unit ore yields 33? Actually processing revenue per unit maybe 1.5? Wait earlier processing actions had per unit change 1.5 positive? For block 3, per unit change 1.5. So processing block 3 ore 33 gave +1.5 per unit => total +49.5? Actually change was 1.5 per unit. Yes. So processing a block yields +1.5 per unit. But extraction cost is -6.21 per unit. So net extraction then processing is -4.71 per unit? Actually extraction cost reduces NPV, processing increases. So net per unit is -6.21 + 1.5 = -4.71. So overall negative. But maybe after extraction you may process later, but maybe extraction also necessary to remove block to allow processing of other blocks? No.\\n\\nThus likely we should not extract any block because all extraction reduces NPV. However we may need to extract at least one block to allow further processing actions? But there are no processing actions available; maybe we should skip extraction? But we must choose one from list. If we choose extraction, NPV will drop. If we choose processing, maybe we can increase NPV. But no processing options now. So maybe we choose extraction that yields lowest cost? All equal. But maybe we have to extract something because we need to reduce future costs. But if no further processing actions will be offered, maybe extraction is not needed. But we might run out of periods and finish. We can still choose extraction, but it lowers NPV. But if we want maximize NPV, we might choose any extraction? Or we might skip? The game probably forces a choice each period. So pick extraction of block with lowest negative change? All equal -6.21. So choose any. But maybe picking block 4 is fine.

Actually after processing 1 unit earlier, block 4 had processed amount 32. But block 4 has remaining processed amount? We need to see state: block 4 tuple: (0.67, 0.0, 32). So block chaudi? Actually third element is extracted amount, fourth is processed. So block 4 has extracted 0, processed 32. There\\'s maybe still extraction potential? We could extract from block 4? But extraction possible? The state says extracted amount 0. But we may extract block 4? But not listed in actions. Probably because extraction not possible? Actually block 4 has no ore? But we have processed some ore, still unprocessed ore? But processed amount is 32, not extracted. But block 4 still has 0 extracted; processed means processed ore? Might be we can process more units if we had ore extracted. But we have processed 32 units but extracted 0. Usually you need extracted ore to process. But maybe they allow processing from extracted ore? Actually in earlier steps, we processed block 4 when we had extracted some ore? Wait earlier block 4 had extracted 0, processed 32 (from earlier action 2 of 1 unit? No earlier processing of block 4: choice 2 amount 1 increased processed to 1. Actually earlier we had processed block 4 1 unit and that increased processed from 0 to 1? Let\\'s track: After extraction of block 4 (choice 1 amount 50, cost -6.21) earlier we processed 1 unit of block 4. That increased processed amount to 1? But state shows processed 32. Wait after processing 1 unit we had processed amount 1. But then we had further actions? Let\\'s recalc.\\n\\nThe timeline:\\n\\n- Initially block 4 had processed amount 32? Actually before that step, block 4 had processed 32. Wait earlier step: \"choice was 1, block_number was: 4, amount was: 50\" changed extracted 50, processed remained 32. Then \"choice was 2, block_number was: 4, amount was: 1\" increased processed to 32? Wait we had processed 1 unit of block 4? The action was (2,4,1). That increased processed to 1? But after that, state shows processed amount 32? Wait state shows block 4: (0.67, 0.0, 32). So processed amount is 32, not 1. That seems weird.\\n\\nLet\\'s re-evaluate: At the state before action list: after last processing action, block 4 had processed amount 32? The tuple: (0.67, 0.0, 32). That indicates extracted 0, processed 32. But we processed 1 unit earlier? The earlier processing action was amount 1. But processed amount now 32? That indicates something else: Maybe the fourth number in tuple is processed amount? Wait earlier block 4 after extraction 50, processed 32. That means processed amount is 32. So initially block 4 had extracted 0, processed 32. Then the possible processing action now is for block 4 amount 32, per unit NPV change 56.45. That seems to process the remaining processed amount? Actually processed amount maybe refers to processed ore still to process? I\\'m confused.\\n\\nLet\\'s analyze: The tuple format: (grade, extracted amount, processed amount). The extracted amount can be >0. The processed amount likely indicates amount processed out of extracted? The actions have (choice, block number, amount, per unit NPV). For processing, you can process ore that has been extracted. So the amount refers to how much to process from the extracted ore of that block.\\n\\nThus block 4 currently has extracted 0, processed 32. That means we previously processed 32 units? Actually earlier we processed block 4 amount 1, not 32. But the state shows processed 32. That means earlier at some point we extracted some ore from block 4 and then processed 32? But no extraction of block 4 hasn\\'t happened. Maybe the processed amount indicates processed ore, but the tuple shows processed amount 32, but we haven\\'t processed that many units. Something inconsistent.\\n\\nAlternatively maybe the tuple is (grade, extracted amount, processed amount) where processed amount is unprocessed extracted ore? Wait maybe the third element is unprocessed extracted ore? The earlier extraction of block 4 had extracted amount 50, processed amount 32. That matches state: (0.67, 0.0, 32). Actually third element is extracted, fourth is processed. So extracted 0, processed 32. So previously we processed 32 units of block 4, but extracted 0? That can\\'t happen. Maybe the tuple (grade, extracted, processed) but processed refers to amount of ore that is ready to process? Actually maybe processed amount refers to amount of ore that has been processed but not yet extracted? No.\\n\\nPossibly the tuple shows the amount of ore extracted (third element) and amount of ore processed (fourth element). So if extracted is 0, processed is 32, that means we processed 32 units of ore that were not extracted? That doesn\\'t make sense.\\n\\nMaybe the logic: extraction reduces extracted amount, and processing increases processed amount. The per unit change in NPV for extraction is negative (cost). For processing is positive (benefit). The state shows extracted and processed amounts as numbers. So we can only process ore that has been extracted. But extracted amount for block 4 is 0, processed amount 32. That suggests we processed 32 units of block 4 before we extracted any. But that\\'s impossible. Possibly the extracted amount is the amount that has been extracted and not processed yet. Processed amount is the amount processed. So extracted amount is ore extracted but not processed. So block 4 had extracted 0 and processed 32 means we had processed 32 units already, but there was no extracted? That can\\'t be. Might be reversed: third element is processed amount, fourth is extracted amount. Let\\'s check earlier: block 4 after extraction of 50 earlier: state shows (0.67, 0.0, 33). That would mean processed 0? Wait earlier we had \"choice was: 1, block_number was: 4, amount was: 50. Current NPV ... state shows block 4: (0.67, 0.0, 33)\". So third element 0.0, fourth 33. That seems to mean extracted 0, processed 33. So after extracting 50 we had 0 extracted, 33 processed? But we never processed block 4 before. Something off.\\n\\nMaybe the tuple is (grade, extraction remaining, processing remaining). But no.\\n\\nAlternatively maybe the tuple (grade, extraction_remaining, processed_remaining). At start block 4 had (0.67, 50, 33). That indicates 50 extracted left? Actually initial block 4 had extracted 50, processed 33. After extracting block 4 50, we had (0.0, 33). So extraction remaining is 0, processed remaining 33? But processed 33 already. Actually that suggests processed 33 from earlier extraction of block 4 50? Wait this seems like the processed amount cannot exceed extracted amount. But maybe processed amount is the amount that has been processed and removed from mine, so it\\'s separate. So extraction reduces extraction remaining, processing reduces processed remaining. The state seems to track amounts left to extract and left to process.\\n\\nLet\\'s re-evaluate: Initial block 4 had (0.67, 50, 33). That means extracted amount 50, processed amount 33? That cannot be; maybe processed amount cannot exceed extracted.\\n\\nI think we don\\'t need to parse fully. We just choose action that gives maximum NPV change per unit times amount.\\n\\nChoices:\\n\\n- extraction 5: amount 50, change -5.64 per unit => total change = -5.64*50 = -282\\n- extraction 7: -282\\n- extraction 8: -282\\n- extraction 9: -282\\n- extraction 11: -282\\n\\n- processing 4: amount 32, change 56.45 per unit => +56.45*32 = +1806.4\\n\\nThus processing block 4 is huge positive. So best action: process block 4 further.\\n\\nThus we choose choice 2, block 4, amount 32.\\n\\nCheck constraints: Extraction cannot be 0 if possible. But we have processing option. We can choose processing action even if extraction possible. There\\'s no rule that forbids processing. So choose processing.\\n\\nThus answer: choice 2, block 4, amount 32.\\n\\n'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 54529512374, 'load_duration': 161375319, 'prompt_eval_count': 3851, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1184364433, 'eval_count': 2049, 'eval_duration': 35954355030}\n",

After they processed 18, the block should have 0 to process. But the state after that (Time_period-8 after choice 1,8,50) shows block 7 still (7,0.72,0.0,18). That means they didn\\'t change it? Wait maybe block 7 is separate: earlier they processed block 7, but maybe the action list didn\\'t include block 7 because it\\'s not processed? Wait confusion.\\n\\nLet\\'s track:\\n\\nAt Time_period-8, initial state: block 7 has (7,0.72,0.0,18). Then they chose action: choice=2, block=7, amount=18. That should have processed 18, updating block 7 to (7,0.72,0.0,0). But the updated state after that shows block 7 still with 18. Maybe there\\'s a mistake? ngaj. Wait the state after processing block 7 shows block 7: (7,0.72,0.0,18) unchanged. So maybe processing of block 7 didn\\'t happen? But they still chose it. The state after the period 8 shows block 8 processed 35, then updated state shows block 8 to (8,0.71,0.0,0). The state after that shows block 7 still 18. This indicates they didn\\'t process block 7; but they chose 2,7,18 earlier? Strange. But maybe block 7 had 18 ton to process originally, but they processed 18 earlier but the state didn\\'t change? This seems inconsistent.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at subsequent state after processing block 8 at Time_period-9: block 7 still has 18 to process? Wait after time period 9 state shows block 7: (7,0.72,0.0,18). But action list says only process 5 from block 7. So maybe block 7 has 5 ton remaining to process. That means originally block 7 had 18 to process, they processed 13 earlier? But earlier they processed 18? Wait maybe they only processed 13? Let\\'s examine: The earlier time period 8 initial had block 7 with 18 to process. At that time, action list didn\\'t include block 7 because they processed earlier? Actually the action list at Time_period-8 before choosing (1,8,50) shows only extraction options; no processing options for 7 or 8 because they have already processed them. But they had processed 18 at period 8. So block 7 after that should be 0, but state still shows 18. Something wrong.\\n\\nPossibility: The list of possible actions for Time_period-8 after processing 18 from block 7 includes only extraction of block 9 etc. So maybe they didn\\'t actually process block 7; they chose to process but the state hasn\\'t changed? This is confusing. But given the current state at Time_period-9, block 7 still has ton to process 18? Actually after time period 9, block 7 still has 18. But action list for period 9 includes processing 7: (2,7,5,42.41). Why amount 5? Maybe block 7 had 5 remaining to process (maybe they processed 13 earlier)? Let\\'s track original: block 7 had 18. At period 8, they processed 18. So ton to process becomes 0. But now we see they can process 5? So maybe they didn\\'t process earlier; perhaps they mis-specified earlier choice as 2,7,18 but the simulation didn\\'t update. In any case, current state still shows block 7 ton to process 18. But action list includes (2,7,5,42.41). So maybe only 5 ton left to process. That suggests block 7 originally had 18, but after some extraction, 13 were processed earlier, leaving 5. But the earlier action didn\\'t do that. But anyway.\\n\\nGiven the state now shows block 7 has 18 to process, but we can only process 5? Maybe the simulation uses \"amount\" as a decision: choose 5. It is possible we can process 5. That gives positive NPV.\\n\\nGiven extraction options are negative, best is to process block 7 with amount 5. This will increase NPV by 5*42.41 = 212.05. So new NPV would be 18387.13 + 212.05 = 18599.18. But maybe there\\'s also processing block 8 with 35 already done. After that, block 8 ton to process 0.\\n\\nThus action: choose processing block 7.\\n\\nLet\\'s output JSON: {\\'choice\\': 2, \\'block_number\\': 7, \\'amount\\': 5}.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 35484268636, 'load_duration': 165285625, 'prompt_eval_count': 3400, 'prompt_eval_duration': 913364019, 'eval_count': 1534, 'eval_duration': 26854971048}\n",

We have current state with many blocks having extracted amounts but some remain. We have possible actions list: only extraction actions (choice 1) on various blocks: 9,13,14,15,16,19,20,23,24. Each has amount to extract, all 50 except block 23 has 40. All have negative NPV per unit (-4.24). Also we have no processing actions remaining? The list only shows extraction. The rule: processing generates revenue. But maybe the remaining extracted blocks have ton to process values. We need to see if any blocks have ton of block to process >0: look at state: block 7 has 13, 8 has 0. 9 has 34? Wait block 9 has (0.68, 50, 34) meaning ore concentration 0.68, ton to extract 50, ton to process 34. Similarly others: 13 has 26, etc. Actually extraction cost negative NPV. Processing yields positive NPV per unit 42.41. But processing actions not listed as possible? The list only shows extraction actions. But maybe after extraction of all blocks, we can process them? But here we have extracted some blocks partially? Let\\'s examine blocks with extraction amounts: block 7 extracted 13 out of 18? Actually block 7 originally had 18 ton to process? Wait block 7: (0.72, 0.0, 18) means no extraction yet, ton to process 18. After we processed 5 earlier, now 13 left. So processing action 7 is still available? But not listed. Actually after we processed 5 earlier, the possible actions list included (2,7,5) earlier. But after that, it\\'s removed. So maybe the system updates possible actions list to only include actions that are feasible. We currently only have extraction actions.\\n\\nThus we must choose an extraction action. But extraction costs negative NPV, so maybe better to wait until we have more extraction cost? But must perform action each period? The instruction: \"Your task is to chose one action ... which is optimal based on maximizing the Net Present Value over a specified number of periods.\" We can choose extraction actions, but each has negative NPV, decreasing overall NPV. But maybe we must eventually process the extracted blocks, which yields positive NPV. We may want to postpone extraction until processing yields? But you cannot process if not extracted. So we must eventually extract all blocks to process. The per unit NPV for processing is positive, but the per unit NPV for extraction is negative. The total net over the block is sum of extraction cost + processing revenue. Let\\'s compute net per unit for each block: For block 9: extraction NPV -4.24, processing 42.41 => net ~38.17 per unit. So beneficial to extract all 50 units eventually. But immediate extraction reduces NPV_Remove? Actually extraction is negative, but we consider overall schedule. Since no processing actions available, we must extract something.\\n\\nHowever we have some blocks partially processed? Blocks 7 and 8 remain to process. But maybe they are not scheduled to process yet? Wait block 7 processing leftover 13, but block 7\\'s processing per unit 42.41, but not listed as possible. Perhaps because after some extraction, the system chooses only extraction actions for blocks that haven\\'t been fully processed? But block 7 still has process left, but perhaps system chooses only extraction actions for blocks that have not yet been processed? But block 7 has remaining to process; but maybe because after partial processing, block 7 now has 13 ton to process, but system may have decided not to offer processing because it\\'s low amount? But list included 7 earlier when remaining 5. After we processed 5, possible actions list no longer includes 7. So maybe after any processing action, block 7 is no longer available to process further because they limit to processing at most once? Actually maybe each block can be processed only once (max ton to process). So after partial processing of 5, the remaining 13 still available but not offered? Might be a bug. But we must choose among listed actions.\\n\\nThus we will extract one of these blocks. Which one to extract to maximize NPV? Since all have same per unit extraction NPV -4.24, but amounts differ: block 23 has 40 units, others 50. If we extract 40, it reduces NPV by 40*4.24=169.6 vs extracting 50 reduces 50*4.24=212. So block 23 is slightly better to postpone? But we may want to keep extraction until processing yields. But we must choose extraction for this period, but we can choose block with smallest amount to extract, to reduce immediate cost.\\n\\nSo choose extraction of block 23 with amount 40. That gives less cost now, and still later we can process. The per unit extraction NPV same. So best to pick block 23.\\n\\nThus answer: choice 1 block 23 amount 40.\\n\\nCheck: The rule says \"if any blocks have not been fully processed, then choose to process them\"? But none available.

Block 23 has 44 ton process amount.\\n\\nPossible actions list: extraction actions for blocks 9,13,14,15,16,19,20,24 each with amount 30 and NPV change -4.24 per ton? Wait the value -4.24 maybe per unit change in NPV if selected (per ton). For extraction, cost. So doing extraction would decrease NPV. So no extraction should be chosen if any processing option available. But are there any processing actions available? No. So we must choose extraction? But constraints: Extraction cannot be 0 amount if possible. But we have extraction options only, all negative NPV change. Maybe we can skip extraction and end period? But instructions: choose one action from possible actions. There\\'s no processing action listed. So we have to pick extraction even though negative. But maybe we can choose to process some other block? Wait block 23 is now ready for processing; but list didn\\'t include processing actions. Maybe because processing not possible due to period? The rule: After full extraction of block you will see that it can also be processed in the next action. But maybe we need to pick processing action for block 23. But list doesn\\'t include it. So maybe we can\\'t process now. So we must extract. Choose maybe block 9 30? But note block 9 has 50 ton extraction left, but 34 ton process maybe later. But extraction cost -4.24 per ton. So choose block with minimal negative? All same -4.24. But we may also consider that we might want to keep block 9 extraction to later process, but we could also postpone? But we must pick one action. Choose block 9 30 extraction. That will reduce NPV by 30*4.24=127.2. Then NPV becomes ~18429.54-127.2=18302.34. But maybe we should choose block 24 30? same.\\n\\nWhich block to choose? Could be any. But maybe choose block with lowest remaining extraction to reduce future negative? Actually all same cost. Might choose block with largest remaining ton to keep more options later? But extraction cost always negative, but if we choose to process a block earlier it would generate revenue. For block 9, after extraction, processing generates revenue per ton 34. So extraction cost -4.24 per ton, processing revenue maybe 34? Wait processing revenue per ton given? The block definition (block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract, ton of block to process). For block 9: (9, 0.68, 50, 34). So extraction ton 50, processing ton 34. So extraction cost -4.24 per ton, processing revenue maybe 34? But it\\'s given as \"per unit ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್\"? The NPV change -4.24 per ton extraction. Processing revenue per ton maybe 34. So block 9 will yield net 34-4.24 = 29.76 per ton if extracted and processed. So maybe we should extract earlier to process later to get revenue. But we could also postpone extraction and maybe process after other blocks? There\\'s no constraint that we must process immediately. So we can postpone. But we must extract now. We should choose block that will lead to more future positive revenue soon? Maybe block 24 extraction: block 24 (24, 0.81, 50, 40). So extraction cost -4.24 per ton, processing revenue 40. So extraction cost 4.24, processing revenue 40 => net 35.76 per ton. But maybe we should choose block 24 to reduce extraction cost and then later process 40 to get revenue 40 per ton? Wait processing revenue maybe 40 per ton? Actually it\\'s the ton to process, not revenue. So processing revenue per ton unknown. But maybe it\\'s ore concentration? The ore concentration maybe influences processing revenue. Hard to decide.\\n\\nBut given extraction cost -4.24 for all, we might pick block with highest ore concentration? The ore concentration might reflect value. For block 9 ore concentration 0.68, processing ton 34. Block 13 ore concentration 0.55, process ton 27. So maybe processing revenue proportional to ore concentration times ton? But unclear.\\n\\nSimplify: choose block 9 30. That seems okay.\\n\\nHowever maybe we can skip extraction by not choosing any?

Wait ton_present refers to ton to extract? The tuple: (block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract, ton of block to process). For block 7: (7,0.72,0.0,13). That means extraction ton present 0, process ton present 13. So extraction of block 7 is 0; but processing available 13.

Actually after previous action we processed 27 of block 23, leaving 17 ton to process. So we could still process block 23 further. But action list does not include processing of block 23 because maybe processed fully? Wait, we processed 27 of 44, leaving 17. But action list does not include (2,23,??).

The rule: after full extraction of block you will see that it can also be processed in the next action. So you cannot process until extraction finished. So currently block 23 can only be processed if extracted fully. But we still have extraction actions for block 23? Not listed. Because block 23's extraction ton is 0? Actually block 23's extraction ton is 0. But we still have remaining extraction ton? Wait block 23: (23, 0.88, 0.0, 17). So extraction ton is 0 meaning fully extracted? Or zero extraction left? The block's extraction ton is remaining ton to extract? In earlier state, block 23 had 0.0 extraction ton because it was fully extracted earlier?

For block 20, per unit -3.86, but has 20 ton left. Extraction of block 20 reduces NPV by 20*3.86=77.2. Similarly block 9 reduces 50*3.86=193. So best is to extract minimal ton?

We have options: 1: extraction for various blocks (cost -3.5 per unit). 2: processing for blocks 9 (34 units), 20 (40), 23 (17) with revenue +35.05 per unit.\\n\\nWe should choose processing on block with highest revenue per unit and available ton. All have same revenue per unit 35.05. Which block to process? We want to process as much as possible? But constraints: We can only process up to ton_present. For block 9 we have 34 ton present. For 20 we have 40. For 23 we have 17. Which gives highest net revenue? Since revenue per ton equal, total revenue = 35.05*tons. But perhaps extraction cost of block 20? Block 20 is already extracted? Wait block 20 currently shows 0 ton present, 41 ton to process? Actually state: block 20 shows (20, 0.83, 0.0, 41). So ton_present 0, ton_to_process 41. So block 20 cannot be processed now? But action says (2,20,40). Wait ton_present 40? But mine state shows 0 ton present. Something inconsistent. Maybe ton_present refers to extraction amount? Actually block 20 had 20 ton initially? Let's examine earlier state: block 20 was originally 20 ton to extract, 41 to process. After extraction of block 20 earlier (choice 1, 20, 20), we set ton_present to 0, ton_to_process to 41. So processing block 20 should have ton_present 0? But action shows (2,20,40). This seems contradictory. Possibly ton_present refers to processed amount? Might be a mistake in state update. But we can still process block 20 with 40 ton? If ton_present is 0, can't process. But the action list includes 20 with 40 ton, maybe the state incorrectly shows 0 but should be 40. We'll assume we can process 40 ton of block 20. But we must decide which block to process.\\n\\nWe also could consider extraction of other blocks for later processing. But we want to maximize NPV. Processing gives positive revenue 35.05 per ton. Extraction costs -3.5 per ton. So net per ton if we extract and then process same block would be +31.55. So we want to process as much as possible.\\n\\nThus choose block 20 with 40 ton if available. That yields revenue 1402 (35.05*40). Alternatively block 9 gives 1136.2, block 23 gives 595.85. So block 20 is best.\\n\\nTherefore action: (2,20,40).\\n\\nBut need to consider extraction cost of block 20 earlier. It already extracted 20 units? The block 20 originally had 20 ton to extract. The earlier extraction cost would haveKY. Already we have extracted 20 and have 41 ton to process. That extraction cost maybe not counted? But it was executed earlier. Now we want to process 40 ton? The block 20 had 41 ton to process. We might process all 41 ton present, but action suggests 40. Could process 41 to maximize revenue? Might be 41 ton present to process.

So extraction cost. And processing (choice 2) presumably for blocks? Wait list: we have only extraction actions. Actually we have no processing actions now because blocks with processable? Let\\'s examine blocks: block 13 has ton to extract 50 and process 26? Wait each block: (block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract, ton of block to process). For block 13: (13,0.53,50,26). That means extraction available 50, processing available 26? But processing only after extraction, so ton_present? The possible actions list shows extraction actions for blocks 13-24. There\\'s no processing actions because maybe no blocks have remaining processable ton? Let\\'s check state: For block 13, extraction 50 available; processing 26 available? Actually after extraction of 50, we have 26 to process. But if not yet extracted, we can\\'t process. So the only actions left are extraction. But the list shows amount 20 for each block. Why 20? Because maybe remaining extraction is 20? Let\\'s see: block 13 originally had 50 extraction, we haven\\'t extracted any yet. But possible actions list says amount 20. Why? Could be because after some extraction? Wait we didn\\'t extract block 13 yet. So extraction amount should be 50, but the action shows 20. Maybe because we have a limit per period? But not defined. Maybe we can only extract 20 units per period.\\n\\nAlso block 22 after extraction of 50 we had 0 extraction left. But the list shows block 22 extraction 20? Wait block 22 originally had 50 extraction and 42 process. We extracted 50 now, so extraction left 0. But list still shows block 22 extraction 20. Hmm inconsistent.\\n\\nMaybe the action list always shows 20 units as a choice for each block but that might not be accurate. But we must choose among given options.\\n\\nAll extraction actions have negative NPV change per unit -3.5. So processing would give positive but no processing actions. So we may beRH stuck.\\n\\nBut the current NPV 20801.34 is after extraction of block 22, which gave -? Wait extraction of block 22 had negative NPV. Yet NPV decreased from 20976.59 to 20801.34: delta -175.25. If per unit -3.5, amount 50, change -175. So consistent.\\n\\nNow we are in period 11, we must decide next action. But if all extraction has negative NPV, maybe it\\'s better to stop extraction and maybe no action? But we must choose one action. If we choose any extraction, NPV decreases by 20 * -3.5 = -70. So NPV will become 20801.34 -70 = 20731.34. Not optimal.\\n\\nCould we skip action? Not allowed. So maybe we should pick block with smallest negative? All same. So pick any. But maybe there are processing actions missing but should be considered? Maybe blocks with remaining processable ton: block 20 has 35 process; block 22 42 process; block 24 40 process. But no processing actions. Maybe because they only allow processing after extraction of block; but block 20 has extraction 0, process 35, but we can process block 20. Yet no processing actions listed.\\n\\nMaybe the action list incomplete. But we must choose among given actions. Maybe the \"choice 2\" processing actions would be for block 20?

Wait we did extraction of 22 earlier; after extraction of 50 we set ton extraction to 0, process 42 to process. But maybe the action list still shows extraction 20 due to partial?

That suggests we cannot process block 22 because maybe the list of possible actions is filtered by rule: you can only process if extraction ton is 0 and ton of block to process >0. But the list does not include any processing. That implies no processing actions are available because none have extraction ton 0? Wait block 14 extraction 50, so extraction available. Block 14 processing 27 available but extraction must be done first. But maybe processing can be performed before extraction? The constraints ambiguous.\\n\\nBut earlier actions processed block 20 after extraction of 14 tons? Wait block 20 extraction ton 14 after we extracted 14? Wait they processed block 20? They processed block 20 with amount 14, processing ton 21? Actually block 20 processing ton originally 21? Wait initial processing ton for block 20 was 35. After extraction 14, processing ton decreased by 14? The list after extraction on block 20 shows processing ton 21. So processing ton decreased accordingly. Means when we extract, we also reduce processing ton by same amount. So extraction ton 14, processing ton 21. That suggests extraction ton and processing ton are the same? Wait earlier block 20 extraction ton 50, processing 35. They processed 14 tons after extraction of 14? They had extraction ton 0, processing 21 after extraction of 14? The list shows block 20 extraction 0, processing 21 after processing 14? Actually block 20 extraction 0 (extracted), processing 21 remained after processing 14? That implies that block 20 processing ton decreased by 14 (from 35 to 21). So extraction ton removed fully? Yes extraction ton became 0. So to process, extraction ton must be 0; processing ton can be reduced.\\n\\nSo we cannot process block 14-18,19,21,24 yet because extraction ton >0. We could process block 22 (processing 2) or 23 (17) etc. But block 22 extraction ton 0 so extraction cannot be chosen; but we could process it if allowed. However the possible actions list didn\\'t include those processing actions because maybe processing requires extraction to be zero? For block 22 extraction ton 0, processing 2; it\\'s processable. But the list didn\\'t show processing action 22? Wait earlier they had processing actions for block 20,22,23. Those were chosen earlier. After extraction of 20, we still have processing ton 21. Wait after processing 20 with 14 ton, processing ton decreased to 21. But extraction ton 0. So block 20 can be processed further? In next list they removed processing action 20 and 22 and 23 because extraction ton 0? Actually after we processed 20, extraction ton 0, processing ton 21. But possible actions list only shows extraction actions. So processing actions are not available? That contradicts earlier statement. But perhaps the list of possible actions only includes extraction actions because there are no processing actions available with ton >0? Wait block 22 extraction 0, processing 2. So processing 22 available. Should appear. But list shows no processing actions. So maybe the problem\\'s rule: We can only process blocks where extraction ton = 0 and processing ton >0. But the list of possible actions must include those processing options. It didn\\'t. So maybe the system omitted them due to some other constraint: maybe only one block can be processed per period and only if extraction ton is zero AND the block hasn\\'t been processed yet? But that still should appear. Possibly the system only generates possible actions based on some heuristics: maybe only blocks that have extraction ton remaining are considered for extraction, and only blocks that have extraction ton = 0 but processing ton >0 are considered for processing. However our list currently lacks processing actions, which is weird. Wait after extraction of 20, processing ton decreased to 21. So processing of 20 is available. But not listed. So perhaps the list of possible actions only includes extraction actions that have not yet been fully processed or extracted. But processing actions only appear when extraction ton = 0? But block 20 extraction ton 0, processing 21, should appear. But it\\'s not there. Maybe the list excludes processing actions because all processing tons are 0? Let\\'s check each block:\\n\\n- 14: extraction 50, processing 27.\\n- 15: extraction 50, processing 25.\\n- 16: extraction 50, processing 34.\\n- 17: extraction 50, processing 35.\\n- 18: extraction 50, processing 33.\\n- 19: extraction 10, processing 40.\\n- 21: extraction 50, processing 38.\\n- 24: extraction 50, processing 17.\\n\\nThus processing ton >0 for all those blocks. So processing actions should exist. But not listed. So maybe processing actions only appear for blocks that have extraction ton 0. So because we haven\\'t processed any block yet, but extraction ton >0, so processing actions are not available. The rule \"Extraction cannot be 0 amount if possible.\" indicates we must extract. So we must pick one extraction action. We want to maximize NPV; extraction costs are negative, but we have to pick one.\\n\\nWhich extraction gives least negative per unit change? All extraction per unit NPV -2.9, same for all blocks 14-18, 19, 21, 24. So per ton cost same. So NPV change = amount * -2.9. We could choose minimal amount >0 to minimize negative impact. But constraint says extraction cannot be 0 amount if possible. But we can extract minimal 1 ton? That would be allowed? The extraction ton is 50, we can choose amount less than that? In earlier actions, they extracted 50 each time. But we could choose smaller to reduce loss. But the rule may want to extract all available ton? Not sure.\\n\\nWe want maximize NPV, so choose smallest possible extraction amount >0. That would be 1 ton for any block. But is that allowed? If we choose extraction action, we need to update extraction ton accordingly. We could pick block 14 with 1 ton. That reduces extraction ton 49. That gives NPV -2.9.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe we can pick extraction on block 19 with only 10 tons available. That reduces NPV -2.9 per ton. 10 ton extraction reduces by 29. That\\'s less than 50 ton extraction. So we might choose block 19 extraction of 10 tons, giving NPV -29, better than -145 for 50 ton. Wait -2.9 per ton; 10 ton => -29. So extraction on 19 is less negative. So choose block 19 extraction with amount 10. That seems best.\\n\\nBut block 19 extraction ton is 10. So we can extract 10. That will reduce NPV by 29. So we should pick that.\\n\\nThus output: {\"choice\":1, \"block_number\":19, \"amount\":10}.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 59379876020, 'load_duration': 166017821, 'prompt_eval_count': 3538, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1071509763, 'eval_count': 2086, 'eval_duration': 36577177990}\n",

We have current state after block19 extraction 10 (so extracted all 10? Actually block19 had 10 ton to extract originally, now after extraction 10, ton_present becomes 0). But block19 still has process ton 40. In possible actions, we only see extraction actions for blocks 14-18,21,24 and no processing for block19 because it\\'s already fully extracted? Wait processing block19 would be 40 ton. But the list does not include (2,19,40,...). Why? Maybe because only blocks that have available ton to process and not fully extracted? Block19 still has 40 ton process. But why not in list? Maybe extraction cannot exceed available ton; but processing block19 might not be allowed because block19 is already extracted? It should be allowed. However list omitted it. Could be a mistake. Or maybe block19 extraction cost is -2.9 per ton, but processing gives 28.97 per ton. But why omitted? Maybe because block19\\'s ore concentration 0.81 and it\\'s still 10 extracted. But maybe block19 extraction has 0 left, so extraction not allowed. But processing should be allowed. But maybe only blocks with ton to process >0 but also have no extraction left? That should still be allowed. But list didn\\'t include it. Let\\'s check block20: ton_present 0, ton_process 21. But not in list either. Actually list includes only extraction options for 14-18,21,24. So only blocks with extraction ton >0. That means they haven\\'t been extracted yet. So processing blocks not yet included until extraction is finished? Wait processing can only happen after full extraction? The instruction: \"After full extraction of block you will see that it can also be processed in the next action.\" So block19 after extraction, it should be available for processing. But maybe time period hasn\\'t advanced? Wait time period remains 13. They just did extraction 10 on block19, which is full extraction. According to rule, after full extraction of block, we will see that it can also be processed in the next action. So now possible actions should include block19 processing. But list didn\\'t include it. Might be an oversight. But we can decide to process block19 40 ton? Let\\'s calculate NPV. For processing block19, per unit change in NPV is 28.97. Amount 40. So NPV increase 1158.8. So new NPV would be 22912.41 + 1158.8 = 24071.21. That seems beneficial.\\n\\nBut we must also consider other blocks: extraction cost -2.9 per ton, processing 28.97 per ton. For blocks 合法的吗: block14 extraction 50, process 27; but block14 hasn\\'t been extracted; but if we process after full extraction? We would need to extract 50 first cost 145. Then processing 27*? Wait block14 process ton 27; processing gives 28.97 per ton. But we might extract first then process. But we can process block14 after extraction? But extraction not finished yet. So no processing yet.\\n\\nWe could choose to process block19 now. But it\\'s not listed. But maybe we can still choose any action not necessarily in list? The problem says \"Choose from possible actions list\". So must choose from list. So cannot pick block19 processing because not listed. So next possible actions are only extraction of blocks with extraction ton >0. Those all cost negative NPV. So to maximize NPV, we should avoid extraction. But maybe we have to pick one. We could choose to not do any action? Not allowed. So we might pick extraction with minimal cost? But we could also wait? The instruction: \"Choose from possible actions.\" So must pick one of listed extraction actions. Which gives negative NPV. So best would be to pick block with smallest cost per ton, i.e., 14-18,21,24 all -2.9. They all have same cost, but we could choose one with less extraction to preserve more? Actually extraction cost reduces NPV; but we might want to extract after processing? Not yet.\\n\\nMaybe we should pick a block with extraction ton that also has process ton high to allow later processing; we might want to finish extraction earlier to allow processing of those blocks later. But for maximizing NPV, processing gives huge positive. So we should process block19 now if possible. But not in list. Maybe the rule: after full extraction, you will see that it can also be processed in the next action. So the \"next action\" refers to next time period? They didn\\'t advance time period; still 13. Maybe time period only changes after a full extraction? But we already did extraction. However maybe after extraction we need to advance period? But they didn\\'t change period. They did extraction 19, then current NPV decreased to 22912.41. Then updated possible actions show no extraction for 20 (0 extracted). They didn\\'t include processing. But maybe because time period hasn\\'t changed, so still same period, but after full extraction, the block can also be processed in the next action but only in the next time period, not same period? The rule ambiguous. It says: \"After full extraction of block you will see that it can also be processed in the next action.\" Could mean next action, not necessarily next period. So processing available now.\\n\\nList omission might be error; but we may still choose to process block19? But assistant must follow list. Probably can\\'t choose unlisted block. Let\\'s decide to pick the least negative extraction to keep NPV high: extraction of 1 ton on a block that has 1 ton? But all extraction options have 50 ton. We could extract 1 ton to maybe later process? But extraction cost is negative, so no gain. But maybe we want to postpone extraction to process later? But cannot process until extracted. So no.\\n\\nThus maybe we should not take any action because we want to maintain NPV? But we must choose something.\\n\\nWe can pick extraction on block14 50? But that will decrease NPV by 145. But maybe later processing will bring 27*? Actually block14 has process ton 27; processing gives 28.97 per ton, so eventual increase 28.97*27=783.39, net +638.39 after extraction cost of -145. So eventually net positive. But we can do extraction now, then later processing. But we could also do extraction on block15, etc. Which one is better to do now? We might prefer to extract block14 first to enable processing later.\\n\\nBut maybe we want to process block19 now, but not listed. If we ignore rule and assume can\\'t process now, we have to choose extraction action. All extraction costs negative; we would reduce NPV. But maybe the goal is to maximize NPV eventually, not necessarily immediate. So we might want to pick the block that has highest extraction cost negative but low process ton to allow later processing? But we cannot process any until extraction done. So if we choose to extract a block, we will reduce NPV but maybe we need to schedule all extraction before processing. But we might want to postpone extraction of all high ore concentration blocks until later. But extraction cost is same for all extraction blocks. So maybe we should postpone extraction until after processing block19 and other blocks? But we cannot skip extraction? We must choose an action. Possibly we can pick to do nothing? Not allowed.\\n\\nThus choose extraction of a block with minimal negative impact? They all same -2.9. So any extraction reduces NPV by 145. But if we will later process that block, we will get 28.97 per ton of process. For each block, processing ton: 14:27, 15:25, 16:34, 17:35, 18:33, 21:38, 24:40. Each would bring large positive. So we want to extract each block eventually, then process. So which one to choose next? Maybe choose extraction of block14? But block14 has ton_present 50 and ton_process 27. We could extract 50 cost 145; later process 27 at 28.97 each gives +783.39 net +638.39. So after extraction and later processing, net positive. So it\\'s beneficial overall. Similarly for others. So any extraction now will not immediately increase NPV but future processing will. But maybe the horizon is limited? Not specified. We should choose extraction that leads to highest eventual NPV. But we need to choose one action. Probably pick extraction of block14 50.\\n\\nHowever, maybe we should process block19 now to get immediate large positive. But not listed. But the instructions might require us to pick only from list. The list excludes block19. So we cannot pick block19 processing. Thus we must pick extraction among given list. So choose block14 extraction 50.\\n\\nThus output JSON: {\"choice\":1,\"block_number\":14,\"amount\":50}.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 52786620257, 'load_duration': 173249040, 'prompt_eval_count': 3528, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1076546501, 'eval_count': 1898, 'eval_duration': 33265814251}\n",

Let\\'s see block 14 now has 0 ton to extract but still 27 processing ton? Wait block 14 originally had 50 ton extract and 27 processing ton. After extraction of 50?

But we might consider whether any processing actions become available later after we reduce extraction? But we might not get revenue. So we need to pick one extraction. We might want to consider later if we can process them. But we need to choose one extraction now. Choose any.

But given that all options are extraction with negative NPV, maybe we should consider that we might be forced to extract to unlock processing later, but currently processing options are not listed. Why? Because after extraction some blocks become available for processing.\\n\\nLook at current state: block 15: ton to extract 50, to process 25. 16: 50 to extract, 34 to process. 17: 50 extract 35 process. 18: 50 extract 33 process. 21: 50 extract 38 process. 24: 40 extract 40 process.\\n\\nProcessing actions not listed because maybe we can only process after extraction is completed? For 19, extraction finished earlier. For 24, extraction amount 40 left 40 to extract. For 24, there is still extraction not complete. So we cannot process until extraction finished. So next action is to continue extraction. But all extraction have negative per unit NPV, maybe we can skip? But we might need to extract all blocks eventually? Maybe the goal is to process as many as possible to generate revenue. But we have limited time periods? Not specified.\\n\\nGiven current NPV is 23791.94. The extraction of any block will reduce NPV by 2.63 per ton. So if we choose 50 ton extraction, NPV reduces by 131.5. That might be the best because we might need to do extraction eventually for some reason.\\n\\nSince all have same marginal NPV loss, we could choose the block with the lowest total cost or maybe the one with highest remaining extraction? But we might want to minimize extraction to reduce future negative NPV, but there might be a requirement to eventually process all blocks? Not sure.\\n\\nThe instructions: \"Your task is to chose one action in following format ... which is optimal based on maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV) over a specified number of periods.\" There is no specified period count. However, the state shows time_period-14. Probably we have more periods to go. The process likely continues until all blocks processed.\\n\\nBut we need to choose best action now. Since all extraction same cost, maybe we should choose the block that has highest processing revenue to offset the cost eventually. But we can process later after extraction areia complete. So we might want to extract blocks that will have large processing amounts but cost per ton is same.\\n\\nThus maybe choose block 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, or 24. Which one to choose first? If we choose block with largest processing revenue per ton? Let\\'s examine block 15: process ton 25. If we process 25 ton after extraction, revenue? Unknown but processing gives positive per unit change 26.33. Wait earlier we saw processing of 14 etc had 26.33. That indicates processing can generate positive NPV change. But we cannot process 15 yet because extraction still incomplete.\\n\\nBut the cost for extraction of 15 is -2.63 per ton. But if we later process 15\\'s 25 ton with positive per unit change of 26.33? Wait the earlier list had processing actions for blocks 14, 19, 20, 22, 23 with per unit change 26.33. So processing 19 (40 ton) gives 26.33 per ton, net positive. So we want to process those first. But we have not yet extracted block 24 fully, so cannot process it. We have processing options for 19 only. But we just processed 19. So block 19 now has extraction completed. We could process 19, but it\\'s already processed. Actually after processing 19, block 19 to process is 0.\\n\\nBut now we still have extraction left for 24 and others.\\n\\nGiven we need to maximize NPV, we might postpone extraction until the block that will generate highest future revenue is processed. But we can\\'t process until extraction done. So we might need to decide which extraction to complete to unlock processing of a high revenue block.\\n\\nWe need to analyze relative revenue of processing for each block.\\n\\nBlock 15: extraction 50, process 25. Processing per ton revenue? The per unit change for processing is maybe 26.33 (from earlier list). Actually earlier list had (2, 14, 27, 26.33), (2, 19, 40, 26.33), (2, 20, 21, 26.33), (2, 22, 2, 26.33), (2, 23, 17, 26.33). So processing for block 15 not listed. Maybe processing for 15 not possible because block 15 had extraction 50, process 25, but maybe we cannot process until extraction done? But extraction not done yet. So we can\\'t process 15.\\n\\nSame for 16, 17, 18, 21, 24. So we need to finish extraction on some block to allow processing.\\n\\nGiven all extraction same cost, we might choose the block that yields the highest processing revenue per ton. That is: block 15: 25 process ton. 16: 34. 17:35. 18:33. 21:38. 24:40. Among these, block 24 has the highest processing revenue (40 ton) per ton processed. But its extraction left 40 ton. So we might choose to extract 40 ton from block 24 to finish extraction, then process 40 ton with positive revenue. But that might produce high overall NPV.\\n\\nAlternatively, block 21 has 50 extraction, 38 process. The processing revenue per ton may be 26.33? Wait earlier processing per unit change 26.33. So each ton processed gives +26.33. Extraction cost is -2.63 per ton. So net positive when processing: -2.63 + 26.33 = +23.70 per ton. So processing block 21 is very profitable.\\n\\nBut we cannot process until extraction finished. So we might want to finish extraction on block 21 to allow processing of 38 ton. That would produce huge revenue. But we might need to finish extraction of 21\\'s 50 ton, which will reduce NPV by 50*2.63=131.5. Then processing 38 ton will add 38*26.33=1000.94. Net gain ~ 869.44. So that is good.\\n\\nThus we might want to choose extraction of 21 now to eventually process 21. However we could choose any block now. But maybe we want to minimize negative NPV by picking the smallest extraction? But we can later process 15 which also yields 25 process. But we might not have time to process all. However we may need to process all eventually.\\n\\nGiven that all extraction actions have same cost, we might as well choose the block that will lead to maximum processing revenue, i.e., block 21 or 24. Block 21 has extraction 50, processing 38. Block 24 has extraction 40, processing 40. So block 24 is slightly better due to processing amount equal to extraction left. But extraction left 40 ton. So we could finish extraction of 24 now. But if we finish 24, we then process 40 ton with positive. Good. Block 21 also yields 38 ton processing.\\n\\nWe want to maximize NPV, we should choose block with higher processing revenue to offset cost. So choose block 21 or 24. But 24 has extraction left 40 ton, processing also 40 ton. So processing 40 ton will yield +40*26.33=1053.2. Extraction cost -40*2.63=105.2. Net +948. So high.\\n\\nBlock 21: extraction 50 -> cost -131.5, processing 38 -> revenue +1000.94. Net +869.44.\\n\\nThus 24 is slightly better. So choose block 24 extraction now. That reduces NPV by 105.2 but eventually net positive.\\n\\nThus next action: extraction of block 24, amount 40 (remaining). So choice 1, block 24, amount 40.\\n\\nThus output JSON.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 88852619302, 'load_duration': 175973803, 'prompt_eval_count': 3426, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1053031800, 'eval_count': 1944, 'eval_duration': 34057377393}\n",

We have available actions:\\n\\nExtraction (choice=1): blocks 15,16,17,18,21 (20 left), 36 with respective ton amounts: 50 for first four, 20 for 21, 50 for 36. Extraction cost negative NPV per unit: -2.39 per ton.\\n\\nProcessing (choice=2): blocks 14 (27), 20 (21), 22 (2), 23 (17), 24 (40). Each gives per unit revenue 23.94 per ton.\\n\\nSo we should process if possible? We need to consider ton availability. For each block, ton to process currently: block 14 has 27 ton to process (present 27). 20 has 21 ton. 22 has 2 ton. 23 has 17 ton. 24 has 40 ton. So all have amounts equal to the action amounts.\\n\\nProcessing gives +23.94 per ton. So choose the block with highest ton? Actually all same NPV per ton. But maybe future decisions? We want maximize NPV over periods; processing gives revenue now. Extraction costs -2.39 per ton; but may create future processing possibilities? We already have 24 processed? After extraction of 24, it becomes available to process? But block 24 has 40 ton to process currently. So processing 24 now yields revenue 40*23.94 = 957.6. So processing any block gives revenue. Which block to process? All same per ton, but we might want to deplete some block's processing so that later we might process less? Maybe we want to process blocks with high concentration? But all concentration equal 0.55, 0.83 etc? Wait concentration values: block 14 has 0.55, block 20 0.83, block 22 0.85, block 23 0.88, block 24 0.81. Higher concentration might give more revenue? But NPV per unit already reflects concentration. So all same per ton.\\n\\nThus any processing block gives same incremental NPV per ton. So choose one that has larger ton to get more immediate NPV? Actually per ton is same, so total incremental NPV scales with ton. So pick the block with highest ton. That is block 24 with 40 ton. So process block 24.\\n\\nBut after that, block 24 will have 0 ton to process. So future options reduce. However we have to consider extraction: maybe extracting some block will create future processing opportunity (like block 24's extraction created that block? But 24 is already processed? Wait block 24 currently has ton to process 40. If we process it, we cannot process again. So we lose future revenue from that block. But we had 24 available for extraction earlier; we extracted all 40? Actually earlier we extracted 40_force? We did extraction of block 24 in prior action (block 24 was extracted? The ton to extract was 40? Wait we had extraction block 24 with amount 40. But block 24's ton to extract after earlier actions? Let's review: After last extraction of 21, block 24 had 0 ton to extract? Wait earlier state: at time period before action 21 extraction, block 24 had 40 ton to extract? Let's check state: In earlier state before extraction of 21, block 24 had 0 ton to extract? Let's check: After we processed 21 and others, block 24 had 0 ton to extract? Wait from earlier: after action 1 21 30, block 21 had 20 left. block 24 had 0 ton to extract (extracted 40 earlier). Yes we extracted all 40 from block 24 previously. That action removed ton to extract 0. But then block 24 still had 40 ton to process because extraction made it ready to process? Wait the extraction of 24 gave us a block with ton to process 40? Actually extraction of a block doesn't create ton to process; the block had ton to process before extraction? The block 24 originally had ton to process 40 and ton to extract 0. After extracting block 24 earlier, we removed extraction quantity; block 24 became 0 ton to extract. But the ton to process remains 40. So the processing amount is still 40. So we haven't processed it yet.\\n\\nNow we choose to process block 24. That seems best immediate NPV. However maybe extraction of other block gives negative but may unlock processing of block 36? But block 36 currently has 50 ton to process but block 36 is not in processing list? Wait block 36 is in extraction list: we can extract 36 (ton 50). But after extraction, block 36 will have 0 ton to extract but will have ton to process 50? Actually block 36 originally had ton to process 30 (30? Let's check earlier state: block 36 has 30 ton to process). After extraction, the ton to process becomes 50? Wait extraction of block 36: extraction reduces ton to extract; after extraction, block 36 will have 0 ton to extract but ton to process 30? Actually before extraction, block 36 had ton to extract 30. After extraction of 30, it will have 0 ton to extract. But the block will have ton to process 30? Wait originally block 36 had 30 ton to process. That hasn't changed yet. So extraction of 36 would make it available to process 30? But we already have that ton to process; extraction may not create extra processing? The processing ton remains same? So extraction is not beneficial.\\n\\nThus choose processing 24. Let's calculate NPV increment: 40*23.94 = 957.6. So new NPV = 23607.61 + 957.6 = 24565.21. But we need just action selection.\\n\\nThus answer: choice=2 block 24 amount 40.\\n\\n\"}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 71225927679, 'load_duration': 164507396, 'prompt_eval_count': 3489, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1060810965, 'eval_count': 1285, 'eval_duration': 22500667617}\n",

Wait previously it had ton_processed 40 before processing; after processing ton_processed becomes 0 and we extracted 0. After processing, we can't process again. Now remaining extraction options: blocks 15,16,17,18,21 have remaining extraction amounts: 50 each except 21 has 20. Block 36 also has extraction 50. Each extraction has cost: -2.39 per ton.\\n\\nWe could also process other blocks that have processed ton? Which blocks have processed ton >0: block 14: ton_processed 27; block 15: 25; 16:34; 17:35; 18:33; 20:21; 22:2; 23:17; 32:50; 33:50. These are potential processing actions (choice=2). But we didn't see processing options earlier because maybe the list only included actions that yield positive incremental NPV per unit? Actually in the updated possible actions list, only extraction actions are listed. Why no processing? Possibly because the list only includes actions that have not been done yet or the NPV per unit positive? Wait the earlier lists had processing actions when per unit NPV positive. In this new list, all have negative cost -2.39. So all extraction negative cost. That means that any extraction will reduce NPV unless later processing provides positive revenue. But the system might schedule extraction first then processing. But we need to choose the best action for this period: either extraction of some block (negative cost) or processing of a block (positive revenue). But the list given only includes extraction actions; so perhaps processing actions are not available because blocks already processed? But blocks 14 etc have processed ton >0 but haven't been processed yet; but maybe processing requires the block number but it's not listed as possible action because maybe you need to choose block that is ready to process: ton_extracted >0 and ton_processed=0? Actually for block 14, ton_extracted 0, ton_processed 27 >0, so it's processed already. Wait block 14 has ton_extracted 0, ton_processed 27; that means block 14 has been processed earlier but not extracted? The block structure maybe (block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract, ton of block to process). So ton_extracted is quantity extracted, ton_processed is quantity processed. For block 14: (14,0.55,0,27). That means 27 tons of block 14 processed earlier? Wait block 14 has 0 extraction but 27 processed? That seems odd: you cannot process before extracting. But maybe the representation means ton_extracted is remaining extraction, ton_processed is remaining processing? Actually original problem statement: array elements structured as (block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract, ton of block to process). So ton of block to extract: amount still to extract? or amount already extracted? It could be remaining to extract. Since for block eksper: e.g., block 15: (15,0.51,50,25). That likely means 50 tons to extract (remaining) and 25 tons to process (remaining). So initial state maybe had ton_extracted 50? But in state, 15 had 50 extraction left, 25 processed left. That implies maybe 25 already processed? But block 15 has 25 processed left to process? Wait earlier we processed block 24 and 24 had 40 processed; then ton_processed became 0 meaning all processed. So ton_processed maybe remaining to process. So a block with ton_processed >0 means still to process; extraction requires the block to be processed? Wait extraction cost negative. The extraction action likely extracts some amount of block, reducing remaining extraction; then later processing would take that extracted amount to get revenue. But if a block has processed ton left, you might process them now. But the list didn't include processing options, perhaps because the only block that is ready for processing (ton_extracted>0) and ton_processed=0 is block 24? But block 24 now has ton_extracted 0 and ton_processed 0. So no block ready to process. That means we can only extract now; after extraction, we could process later. So the best action is to do extraction of the block that yields best future processing profit? But we need to decide for this period only. Extraction will reduce NPV by cost. But maybe future periods we can process, but we have limited periods left? We are at Time_period-15; maybe next period we will have processing options for blocks that are ready after extraction. The scheduler might choose extraction of block with highest ore concentration to maximize future revenue. But we don't see future list. But the problem says choose action that maximizes NPV for this period. But extraction is negative; processing positive. But no processing options listed means maybe no block has processed ton ready. Actually for blocks 14 etc ton_processed >0: but perhaps that means already processed, so cannot process again. So processing actions only listed when block has ton_extracted >0 and ton_processed >0? Wait earlier we had processing actions when per unit NPV positive. Those had block numbers 14,20,22,23,24 etc. Those had ton_extracted 0 and ton_processed >0. Wait block 14 had ton_extracted 0, ton_processed 27, so that was processed. Then why processing action 2 for block 14 appears with amount 27 and per unit NPV 23.94? So that indicates that the processing action is to process that remaining processed ton? That seems weird. Actually maybe ton_extracted is remaining extraction quantity; ton_processed is quantity ready to process (extracted but not processed). So for block 14: ton_extracted 0 means nothing left to extract; ton_processed 27 means 27 tons are ready to process. Yes, that fits. So block 14 has 27 tons ready to process. Processing that yields revenue per unit 23.94. So processing actions exist. But new list only includes extraction actions. Maybe because all blocks with processed ton >0 but extraction already done cannot be processed? Wait block 14 has 0 extraction, 27 processed ready, yes processing can be done. But list didn't include processing because maybe after last processing, block 24 was processed and now no more ready-to-process blocks? But we have 14,15,16,... etc. So why omitted? Possibly because there is a limit of number of actions per period; maybe we can only process one block per period, but only blocks that are ready? But list didn't include them, maybe because the function chooses only actions that will yield net positive incremental NPV at this period? But we saw earlier lists including processing actions when per unit NPV positive (23.94). But now after processing block 24, maybe those processing actions no longer available because we must process only blocks that are already processed? Actually they were available earlier when per unit positive. So why not now? Because maybe processing blocks now will not be profitable due to discount? The per unit NPV values might be updated to reflect the remaining time horizon. For block 14, per unit 23.94 maybe from previous list. Now in updated list, only extraction actions. So maybe the system already processed all blocks with ready processed ton >0? Wait earlier we processed block 24, now block 14,15 etc maybe still have processed ton >0 but not processed? But earlier we had processing actions for block 14 etc with per unit 23.94. So why not now? Maybe because we have already processed them earlier; but ton_processed >0 means processed; but we didn't extract them. But block 14 has ton_extracted 0 and ton_processed 27; that means 27 processed already; but maybe the representation of ton of block to process is the amount still to process (remaining). Actually maybe ton of block to process is the amount still to process. For block 14, ton processed 27 means 27 remaining to process. So not yet processed. That would mean we can process block 14. Then per unit revenue 23.94. Yes earlier we had processing action list containing (2,14,27,23.94). So block 14 still pending processing. So why not present now? Because maybe after processing block 24, the per unit NPV for processing block 14 changed? But maybe due to time discount? Let's calculate: per unit NPV for processing block 14 remains 23.94. But it's not listed. Could be because we already performed processing for block 14 earlier, but ton_processed 27 indicates remaining to process. Wait maybe after extraction we need to process; but block 14 had 0 extraction, so maybe cannot process. Wait ton of block to process maybe refers to amount already processed? But not likely.\\n\\nAlternatively maybe the possible actions list is limited to those actions that are available for the current period given the current state of extracted/processed amounts. For block 14, ton_processed=27 but ton_extracted=0. That means block 14 has already been extracted and processed? But we see 27 processed, but extraction 0 indicates maybe extraction finished. So cannot process again.\\n\\nThus only extraction actions are available. Then we must choose extraction with minimal negative cost? But extraction will reduce NPV. Maybe best action is to do nothing? But must choose one action. If we choose extraction, NPV decreases. But perhaps we should process block 21 or 36? Wait but list does not include processing actions. Might be because all processing actions have been completed earlier. But block 32 and 33 processed, block 15, etc processed.\\n\\nWe must choose the extraction with smallest negative cost to minimize NPV drop? But the system may prefer to wait until later periods to process; but extraction will reduce NPV now. But maybe no other options: cannot skip action. So choose extraction of block with smallest extraction remaining? block 21 has only 20 remaining, so cost -2.39 per ton. So extraction of 20 will reduce NPV by 20*2.39=47.8. That is smallest penalty among extraction options? Check block 36 has 50. Others 15-18 have 50 each. So block 21 extraction 20 is best.\\n\\nThus choose extraction of block 21 amount 20. That yields NPV new: 24565.18 - (20*2.39) = 24565.18 - 47.8 = 24517.38. Wait that is less than current 24565.18. But maybe we want to maximize NPV, so maybe better not to extract at all? But must choose one action. If we can choose no action, keep 24565.18. But problem says choose from possible actions. So must pick one. But if all reduce NPV, maybe best to minimize loss. So choose block 21 20. Alternatively choose block 15 or others 50, more penalty. So choose 21 20.\\n\\nThus output extraction block 21 amount 20.\\n\\nLet's output JSON.\"}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 65773394023, 'load_duration': 169067507, 'prompt_eval_count': 3425, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1052924599, 'eval_count': 2390, 'eval_duration': 41891384295}\n",

We might consider which block is better to process later; maybe the one with higher ore concentration leads to higher revenue when processed. Let\\'s look at ore concentrations: block 15 concentration 0.51, block 16 0.69, 17 0.71, 18 0.66, 36 has 0? Wait block 36 is 0.0. So processing block 36 yields no ore? Actually block 36 has ore concentration 0.0, ton to extract 0? It shows 0.0, 0, 0? Actually block 36 is (36, 0.0, 0, 0). No extraction left. So cannot extract from 36. So choose one of 15-18. Which has highest concentration? 17 (0.71) or 16 (0.69). So maybe choose block 17 to extract, because highest concentration for later processing. So choose extraction of block 17 amount 49.\\n\\nThus JSON: {\"choice\":1,\"block_number\":17,\"amount\":49}.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 30340725200, 'load_duration': 170226292, 'prompt_eval_count': 3404, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1039229891, 'eval_count': 473, 'eval_duration': 8224974073}\n",

It might be optimal to process all available, but we need to choose one action at a time. Probably pick the block with highest ton? Because each unit yields same 21.76, but processing 38 vs 27? There's no limit per period. So maybe choose block with highest ton to maximize NPV. However, the amount to process is not forced to be full; we can choose amount. But if we process full block 21 (38 tons) we get 38*21.76 = 827.68. That's best. We could also process block 14 (27*21.76 = 587.52).

There are 27 ton of block to process. But we only have 2 amount available? Wait block 14 currently has ton to process 27? Actually the tuple shows (block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract, ton of block to process). For block 14: (14, 0.55, 0.0, 27). So 27 ton to process. But action says (2,14,2,21.76).

The actions list: all are extraction actions (choice 1). Each has cost per unit change -2.18 or -2.18. So extraction cost per ton? We have block numbers: 15,16,17,18,36. We need to decide amount. We want to extract as much as possible to enable processing later maybe? But processing gives revenue. However we haven\\'t processed anything yet. But we might need to extract more to be able to process later. Which block has processing revenue? Blocks 14,20,21,22,23 have processing options. But we have partially extracted block 14? After processing 14, we have 0 ton processed? In state: block 14 has (0.55,0,25). Wait 14 currently has ton_present 0? It shows (14, 0.55, 0, 27). So we have 0 ton present? The amount to process is 27. But we can only process if there is ton present (extracted). So we need to extract block 14 before processing. But we have not extracted block 14 yet. So we might want to extract from block 14? But extraction action list does not include 14 because we need extraction of block 14? But block 14 currently has ton_present 0. So we cannot extract 14 (no ton). So we cannot process 14 now. So which block is available for processing? Let\\'s inspect blocks with ton_present >0: 15 has 49, 16 has 50, 17 has 1, 18 has 50, 20 has 0, 21 has 0, 22 has 0, 23 has 0. So only blocks 15,16,17,18 have extracted ton to process. But we haven\\'t processed any yet. So we could process some of them to generate revenue. The actions list only shows extraction actions though. Maybe the list only shows extraction actions possible, not processing because you haven\\'t processed yet? But we have processing options for blocks 14,20,21,22,23 earlier. But those have 0 ton. So no.\\n\\nBut maybe we can process blocks 15,16,17,18 now. But not listed because maybe they are already processed partially? Let\\'s inspect block 15: (15, 0.51, 49, 25). Means 49 ton present (extracted) and 25 ton to process? Wait ton of block to process maybe the processing capacity? Usually if you process you convert ton of block to processed ton. So we can process up to 25? Or 49? The tuple: (block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract, ton of block to process). So 49 ton to extract; 25 ton to process? Means you can process 25 ton of block after extraction. So we could process 25 ton from block 15.\\n\\nWe need to choose an action. Options: extraction actions only? But we can also process if possible. But list does not include process options.:\\n\\n\\n\\nWe might be in the situation where we have processed block 14 already? Wait earlier we processed 14 partially? But after that, block 14 had ton_present 0, process amount 2? Wait earlier list had processing for block 14 (2,21.76). That changed from 27 to 2 ton processed. So 14 had 0 ton present? Actually after processing, ton_present became 0, process amount 2. So after we processed 14, we still had 2 ton to process? That indicates we processed 25 ton of block 14? But block 14 originally had ton_present 0? Wait initial state had (14,0.55,0,27). So after processing 14, ton_present should still 0 but processed ton? But the field ton of block to process might be processed ton quantity left? Or the processed ton left? Hard.\\n\\nHowever list shows extraction actions for blocks 15,16,17,18,36.\\n\\nGiven all extraction costs same, we might want to extract from block with highest ore concentration to enable future processing. Block 15 concentration 0.51; 16 concentration 0.69; 17 concentration 0.71; 18 concentration 0.66. So 16 highest. 16 extraction cost -2.18 per ton. After extraction, we could process up to 34? Wait block 16 tuple: (16,0.69,50,34). Means 50 ton extracted and 34 ton process.\\n\\nSo maybe we should extract from block 16 as much as possible, because after extraction we can process 34 ton.\\n\\nBut we also have block 18 with 50 ton and 33 ton to process.\\n\\nBut we need to decide amount to extract. Which block has remaining extraction capacity? 15 has 49 remaining; 16 has 50; 17 has 1; 18 has 50; 36 has 50. We need to decide best extraction plan.\\n\\nHowever maybe we want to extract all available to process later. But extraction cost reduces NPV by cost. Processing gives revenue per ton times ore concentration? But processing revenue per ton maybe ore concentration times something. Not given. We only have change -2.18 for extraction; we need to decide which yields best NPV after processing.\\n\\nIf we process block 15 for 25 ton, revenue per ton might be 25 * ore concentration 0.51? That seems small. But processing gives revenue. We should check possible processing actions earlier: they had positive change 21.76. So processing had revenue of 21.76 per ton? Actually earlier we processed block 14: after that NPV increased from 25268 to 25268.13? Wait earlier we processed block 14 with amount 2 and NPV increased 39.5? Let\\'s check: At Time_period-16 after actions list, NPV is 25268.13 after processing block 14 with amount 2. Then possible actions list includes processing options for blocks 14,20,22,23? But after processing block 14, ton_present of 14 is 0? It shows block 14: (0.55, 0,25). So 0 ton present. But we processed 2 ton? Wait after processing block 14, ton_present remains 0? That seems wrong. But we had 0 ton present but 25 ton to process. But after processing, ton_present might remain 0 but processed ton increases? But not shown. So maybe we cannot process block 14 now because no extracted ton present.\\n\\nThus the remaining possible actions are extraction only. We need to decide which block to extract from.\\n\\nMaybe we should extract from block 18, because ore concentration 0.66, extraction cost -2.18, but processing later could generate revenue. Similarly block 16 has higher ore concentration 0.69.\\n\\nBut extraction cost is same. So we should extract from block with highest ore concentration to maximize future processing revenue. Thus block 16 has 0.69. So extract from 16 as much as possible. So choice: extraction from block 16, amount 50 (full). That will cost 50*2.18 = 109? Actually -2.18 per ton change. So NPV will drop by 109? But we haven\\'t accounted processing. Wait if we extract, we increase ton_present and reduce remaining extraction? Actually we are extracting further from block 16? Wait ton_present 50 already? Actually block 16 currently has (50 extracted). So maybe we have 0 remaining? Wait 16 had 50 ton to extract originally. We have extracted 50 ton. So maybe we have already extracted full block. So cannot extract further. So extraction action 16 with amount 50 likely refers to processing? But the tuple says ton to process 34. So maybe 50 ton present is extracted; we cannot extract more. So extraction action 16 should not exist. So maybe extraction action 16 is for processing? The cost per unit change -2.18 suggests extraction? But processing would be positive revenue per ton, not cost. But list shows cost negative. So these must be extraction.\\n\\nBut block 16 has 50 ton extracted; no more to extract. So extraction action of 16 would be invalid. But they still list 16? maybe it\\'s allowed because we can \"extract\" again from block that has ton_present? But ton_present indicates \"ton of block to extract\", not extracted. Wait tuple: ton of block to extract indicates amount left to extract? Actually 16 had 50 ton of block to extract originally. So maybe ton_present means \"ton of block to extract\" and ton to process refers to \"ton of block to process\" after extraction? So 50 ton of block to extract; 34 ton to process. That means we haven\\'t extracted yet. The \"ton of block to extract\" is the remaining extraction needed? So we can choose extraction amount to reduce that. So extraction actions reduce ton of block to extract. That matches earlier: we extracted block 14 amount 2, reducing ton_present from 27 to 25. So indeed block 14 had 27 ton to extract originally? Wait 14 had 27 ton to extract originally. After processing we reduced to 25? Actually after processing 14, we decreased ton_present from 27 to 25, because we extracted 2. So yes ton_present is extraction remaining, not extracted already. Wait we processed 14? No we processed 14? We only extracted block 14 amount 2. But the earlier actions list had process options for block 14 (amount 2). That suggests we have processed block 14 2 ton? Actually we processed block 14 with amount 2 and NPV increased. So block 14 originally had ton_present 27, and after processing, ton_present decreased by 2 to 25, and processing ton decreased? The tuple for 14 now shows (14,0.55,0,25). That seems wrong: ton_present 0? Actually 14 now shows 0,25. That indicates we have 0 ton extracted? That doesn\\'t match. Perhaps after processing, the extracted ton becomes 0, processed ton remains? I\\'m confused.\\n\\nIt seems that block 14 had 27 ton to extract originally. After we processed 14 by amount 2? That should reduce ton to process maybe? Actually processing reduces \"ton of block to process\" field? The list of possible actions earlier for 14 had amount 2, positive 21.76 change. That indicates we processed 2 ton, increasing NPV by 21.76 per ton. After that, block 14 tuple changed to (0.55, 0, 25). Means 0 ton to extract left, 25 ton to process left. That seems we extracted entire block (27 ton extraction) earlier? Wait 14 originally had (0.55,0,27). That indicates no extracted ton but 27 ton to process? That doesn\\'t make sense.\\n\\nMaybe the tuple actually means: ton to extract and ton to process are remaining capacities? After processing, the amount to process decreases.\\n\\nGiven confusion, maybe we just follow instructions: choose extraction action. Since all extraction actions have equal cost -2.18, choose one with highest remaining ton to extract? But all have same. But maybe we can extract any amount. We want to minimize cost now, but maybe we need to preserve ton for processing? But extraction is needed to enable processing, but we can process now? The possible actions list only extraction. But we could also process now if we want. But not listed, so maybe we can\\'t process now. So we have to extract to allow future processing. Which block to extract? Maybe we want to extract from block 18 because ore concentration 0.66 is high. Or block 16 with 0.69. Which has higher ore concentration? 16 has 0.69 > 0.66 > 0.71? Wait block 17 has 0.71 but only 1 ton. So we could process block 17 later. So extraction from 16 yields higher ore.\\n\\nThus choose block 16, amount 50. That will fully extract block 16? Actually block 16 had 50 ton to extract. So we will reduce it to 0. That means no further extraction possible. Then we can process block 16 later.\\n\\nHence action: choice 1, block 16, amount 50.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 52803218672, 'load_duration': 166675059, 'prompt_eval_count': 3445, 'prompt_eval_duration': 927557219, 'eval_count': 2655, 'eval_duration': 46536069647}\n",

Wait per unit change in NPV is 21.76 for processing block 15? In actions list, we have no processing action for 15? In earlier actions, we had (2, 15, 25, 21.76) but not now? Wait the list now: only extraction actions. Means maybe processing block 15 already processed? Actually block 15 still ton_present 49, process ton 25. But maybe processing cost changes? In the earlier state, after we processed 15 partially, still ton_present 49. Maybe the remaining block 15 cannot be processed because processing unit remaining maybe 25?

Actually given array: (block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract, ton of block to process). For block 15, ton_extract=49, ton_process=25. This means extraction remaining 49, processing remaining 25. But we previously extracted some? Wait we did extraction on block 15 earlier? Not yet. So we can still extract or process. But action list missing processing for block 15 maybe because we cannot process until after extraction? But extraction is still available. However maybe the processing per unit NPV of 21.76 is same for block 15, but omitted due to limit? Might be omitted because cannot process block 15 because its ore concentration maybe 0.51 low? Actually 0.51 moderate. But we have actions for processing block 14, 20, 21, 22, 23. These are all with ton_present 0? Wait block 14 ton_present 0? Block 14 is (14, 0.55, 0, 25). ton_present 0, but processing still possible? Yes processing may occur on block even if extraction done (ton_present 0). That seems allowed: after extraction fully, you can still process remaining block. For block 14, ton_present 0, process 25. For block 20, ton_present 0, process 21. For block 21, ton_present 0, process 38. For block 22, ton_present 0, process 2. For block 23, ton_present 0, process 17. Those are processing actions. So block 15 hasn't been processed? Wait we did not process 15 earlier. But there is no action for processing 15? Maybe because block 15 has not been extracted? The processing requires extraction first; but maybe we haven't extractedikis? The array shows ton_extract 49. So extraction remaining 49. So we could extract part of block 15. After extraction, ton_present 0? But ton_present 49 indicates not yet extracted? Wait confusion.\\n\\nHowever, actions list indicates we have four extraction options: 15, 17, 18, 36. Each extraction reduces NPV by -2.18 per unit.\\n\\nWhich is better? Since all negative, we should maybe skip? But must we take an action? The instruction says choose from possible actions. So we must pick one. Which gives least negative? All same -2.18 per unit. But amounts vary: 20 for block 15? Wait list shows (1,15,20,-2.18). That means extract 20 units from block 15? Actually ton_extract 20. But block 15 has 49 extraction left. So extracting 20 reduces NPV by 20*2.18 = 43.6. 17 has 1, 18 has 20, 36 has 20. We want minimize loss. Maybe we should choose the one with smallest amount: block 17 has 1. That yields -2.18 loss only. That seems best. So choose extraction of 1 from block 17.\\n\\nCheck block 17: (17, 0.71, 1, 35). ton_extract=1, ton_process=35. Already extraction minimal but still present 1. We can extract 1 or process after extraction? Actually we can process block 17 after extraction done. ton_process 35. Processing gives revenue per unit? Not in list but earlier had (2,17,35,21.76) maybe. So processing block 17 gives same revenue 21.76 per unit? Might be. But action list now only extraction for block 17. So maybe we cannot process block 17 because extraction must be done? Actually we have ton_present 1, but processing might be available if extraction already done? But no, extraction still pending.

The fourth is ton of block to process (remaining). For blocks with extraction >0 but process=0? Actually some blocks have extraction=0 and process=0 meaning nothing extracted yet. For block 14, extraction=0 process=25 means 25 ton available to process (already extracted). For block 15, extraction=30, process=25. Means 30 Cauc? Wait extraction remaining? After extraction, there is still 30 ton not yet processed? The 15 block shows extraction=30 process=25. That indicates 30 ton of block to extract still (maybe not extracted yet). But process=25 ton is already extracted and ready to process. So we can process at most 25 ton from block 15 (unless extraction also used for processing). For block 16: extraction=0, process=34. So 34 ton available to process.\\n\\nFor block 18: extraction=50, process=33. That block has 50 ton remaining to extract? Wait extraction=50 indicates there is 50 ton to extract. That is the whole block? Actually block 18 originally had 50 ton to extract, hasn\\'t been extracted. So extraction remaining 50. process=33 indicates maybe 33 ton ready to process? That seems inconsistent: extraction 50, process 33 means 33 ton extracted? But extraction remaining 50 means nothing extracted. Actually extraction remaining is ton of block that has not yet been extracted. process remaining is ton of block ready to process. If block is not extracted, process would be 0. But block 18 has extraction 50 and process 33: indicates maybe block 18 has been partially extracted? Wait extraction 50 indicates 50 ton left to extract; process 33 indicates 33 ton ready to process (maybe extracted). That implies there was extraction already done on block 18? But that would reduce extraction? I\\'m not certain.\\n\\nBut we need to consider available ton to process for processing actions. For processing actions list: \\n(2,14,25, 19.78)\\n(2,16,34, 19.78)\\n(2,17,35, 19.78)\\n(2,20,21, 19.78)\\n(2,22,2, 19.78)\\n(2,23,17, 19.78)\\n\\nProcessing action amounts: ton to process; but we must ensure we don\\'t exceed the block\\'s current \"process\" ton. Let\\'s check block 14: process currently 25; action (2,14,25) matches. Good. Block 16: process 34; action (2,16,34) matches. Block 17: process 35; action (2,17,35) matches. Block 20: process 21; action (2,20,21) matches. Block 22: process 2; action (2,22,2). Block23: process 17; action (2,23,17). So all these are valid.\\n\\nNow extraction actions: We have extraction amounts for blocks 15 and 18. Block 15 extraction remaining 30. Block 18 extraction remaining 50. We also have block 25,26,27,28,29,30,31,34,35,36 all extraction 50 but process 0. And maybe other blocks extraction 0 but process 0. So we can extract from these blocks if we want.\\n\\nBut we should consider the per unit change in NPV. We want the best incremental. The positive ones: all processing actions have per unit change 19.78. The negative extraction actions have per unit -1.98 (for 15 with 30 ton, per unit -1.98) or -1.98 for 18 with 50, or -1.98 for 36 with 50. Actually the per unit for extraction actions are negative (cost). The positive ones are 19.78 for processing.\\n\\nWhich block gives higher per unit NPV? All processing actions are 19.78. So any processing action will increase NPV by 19.78 per ton. Extraction actions will decrease NPV by 1.98 or 1.98.\\n\\nThus we should choose a processing action to maximize NPV. But we also have to consider we might want to process all available ton from a block at once? The amount is the ton to process. For example, action (2,14,25) indicates processing 25 ton of block 14, which is the total available. That yields +19.78 per ton. The total NPV increase would be 25*19.78 = 494.5? Actually 25*19.78 = 494.5. Similarly, block 16 has process 34: 34*19.78 = 672.92. Block 17 process 35: 692.3. Block20 process 21: 416.0. Block22 process 2: 39.56. Block23 process 17: 336.26.\\n\\nWe might want to process the block with the highest total NPV: block 16 has 34 ton, 34*19.78 = 672.92. That seems best. Block17 also 35 ton *19.78 = 692.3? Wait 35*19.78 = 692.3. Yes block17 has slightly higher total NPV (692.3). Block14 has 25 ton *19.78 = 494.5. Block20 has 21 ton *19.78 = 416.0. Block22: 2*19.78=39.56. Block23: 17*19.78=336.26.\\n\\nSo best total is block17 process 35 ton. So we should pick (2,17,35). But we need to check if block 17 has process ton available. In state, block 17: (17,0.71,0.0,35). process=35, yes. So we can process all 35 ton. That yields a NPV increase of 35*19.78 = 692.3.\\n\\nThus NPV will increase from 25115.79 to 25115.79 + 692.3 = 25808.09 approx. That is the new NPV after processing.

But we are at period 17 and maybe next period 18 will allow processing. But we need immediate NPV? The NPV change for extraction is negative per ton. So best is not to extract any? But constraint: Extraction cannot be 0 if possible. But maybe we have to pick one. Since all same cost, choose any. But consider future: Which block to extract now that yields highest potential processing revenue later. The processing revenue per unit is constant? The actions list for processing: earlier we had processing options with 19.78 per ton. So the net NPV per ton if we process is +19.78. So extraction then processing yields net +17.8 per ton.

The ton to extract indicates how many tons available for extraction? Actually block 18: (18,0.66,50,33). Means ore concentration 0.66, 50 tons of block to extract, 33 tons to process? Wait after extraction, you get ore to process? Probably extraction cost per ton, processing revenue per ton? The per unit change in NPV in actions list.\\n\\nThe actions: For each block, two types: choice 1 (extraction) cost, choice 2 (processing) revenue. The amount available for action equals the ton present? For extraction, amount = ton to extract; for processing, amount = ton to process? In updated actions: (2,14,6,17.99) means process block 14, amount 6? The block 14 currently has (14,0.55,0,25). It had 25 tons of block to process. But action says 6? Why 6? Maybe it\\'s limited by something else like a period limit? Not sure.\\n\\nIn current state: block 14 has 0 to extract, 25 to process. Block 15: 0 extract, 25 to process. Block 16: 0 extract, 0 to process? Wait after we processed 16 earlier, we had 0 to process. Indeed after action 2 on block 16, we used all 34 tons. So block 16 now 0 to process. So remaining processable blocks: 14 (25), 15 (25), 20 (21), 22 (2), 23 (12). Also 18 maybe 33 to process but not available? Wait block 18 has 50 to extract, 33 to process. After extraction of 18? No we haven\\'t extracted 18 yet. So 18 has 50 extract, 33 process. But to process 18 we need to have extracted it first? In state, 18 shows ton to extract 50, ton to process 33. So we could process 18 only after extraction. But we haven\\'t extracted 18 yet, but action list includes (1,18,50, -1.8) extraction possible. So we can choose extraction of 18 or extraction of 28,32,36. Extraction of 28,32,36: these blocks have 50 to extract and 0 to process except 32 has 10 to process already after partial extraction? Wait block 32: after we extracted 40 earlier, it had 10 remaining to extract and 50 to process? Actually block 32 had (32,1.0,10,50). Means 10 tons to extract, 50 to process. So we can extract up to 10, then process all 50? The action (1,32 mux 10) indicates extraction cost -1.8 per ton. So small amount.\\n\\nBut processing blocks 14,15,16,20,22,23 have high NPV per ton 17.99. That is huge positive. So we should process these. Which block has most ton? 14: 25, 15:25, 20:21, 23:12, 22:2, 18:33 if extracted.\\n\\nProcessing 14: 25 tons gives +17.99*25 = 449.75. Processing 15 same. Processing 20: 21 tons gives +17.99*21 = 377.79. 23:12 gives +215.88. 22:2 gives +35.98. So total if we process all: 449.75+449.75+377.79+35.98+215.88=1489.15 NPV increase. Extraction of 18: 50 tons cost -1.8 per ton => -90. So extraction negative. Extraction of 28: -90. Extraction of 36: -90. Extraction of 32: (10) cost -1.8 per ton => -18. So extraction actions are negative NPV. So we definitely want to process. However, we must consider that processing actions are only available after extraction is done. For 18, we can process only after extraction. But maybe the action list indicates we can process block 18 after extraction? No extraction hasn\\'t happened, so action list shows only extraction for 18.\\n\\nSo we have options: process 14,15,20,22,23. All positive NPV. Which block gives highest per unit? They all have same per unit 17.99. So all equal. But we need to consider that processing 14 or 15 yields same. But perhaps we have capacity constraints: maybe each period we can process a limited ton? But the amount field might reflect the limit of ton we can process in current period. The action list amounts for processing 14:6. That indicates maybe we have limited processing capacity of 6 per period? Or maybe we have 6 tons of ore available to process from block 14. Wait block 14 had 25 to process but action says 6. So maybe there\\'s a \"processing ton\" variable that is less than or equal to ton to process in state. Could be that \"ton to process\" after extraction is the available ore, but maybe we can\\'t process all due to period limit; the amount is the max you can process this period. Might be that each period you can process at most 6 tons of ore? That seems plausible because actions show 6 for many process blocks. Initially before we processed 16, amounts were 25 or 21 or 2. So not 6. But after extraction of 16, the amounts for processing changed to 6. That indicates after some processing action, the amount decreased? Wait earlier we had actions list: after processing 16 (34 tons), next actions: (2,14,6,17.99), (2,15,6,17.99), (2,20,6,17.99), (2,23,6,17.99). These amounts are 6. Block 14 had 25 to process originally, but after period 18 we see (2,14,6). So maybe there\\'s a processing capacity per period of 6? But then 23 had 12 to process originally; after earlier processing 23 maybe 6 left. Wait after we processed 23 earlier, block 23 had 12 to process and we processed all 12. After processing 23, block 23 becomes (23,0.88,0,0). In state after processing 16, 23 still had 12. But after we processed 23 earlier, we had 12 to process but we processed it? Wait we didn\\'t process 23 earlier. We processed block 16. So 23 still 12. But in new actions list, amount for 23 is 6. So maybe half of 12 left? Actually earlier after extraction of 16 we didn\\'t modify 23. So why amount 6? Maybe there\\'s a global limit of 6 tons per period for processing? The amount indicates the max we can process this period. But block 14 originally had 25 to process; maybe we can only process 6 per period. So action list shows 6 as amount for those blocks, except 32 had 10 to process? Wait block 32 had 10 to extract and 50 to process. But after we extracted 10, we have 10 extract remaining, 50 process. So the action (1,32,10) extraction of 10. But the processing amount 50 is available but per period maybe only 6 can be processed? But action list shows for block 32 not processing. So maybe we cannot process 32 yet.\\n\\nThus at period 18, we can only process blocks 14,15,20,22,23 with amount 6 or 2. The amounts for 14 and 15 and 20 are 6 each? Actually 20 had 21 to process; but action shows 6. 22 had 2 to process; action 2 shows 2. 23 had 12 to process; action shows 6.\\n\\nSo seems each processing action has a maximum of 6 tons per period, except block 22 only 2.\\n\\nThus we need to choose a processing action with maximum NPV incremental per ton 17.99. All equal. But amounts differ: 6,6,6,2,6. To maximize NPV, choose largest amount: 6. But we also might consider that processing 22 (2) gives same per ton but less total. So we pick one with amount 6.\\n\\nThus we should choose any of the blocks with 6 amount: 14,15,20,23. All same per ton. Which to choose? Possibly we should choose the one with highest ore concentration? But per unit NPV already accounts for concentration. But all same 17.99 per ton maybe because they have same concentration? Actually block 14 concentration 0.55, 15 0.51, 20 0.83, 23 0.88. They differ. But per unit NPV same? That seems odd. Might be that concentration differences are already integrated into per unit change. But maybe the 17.99 is just placeholder.\\n\\nBut maybe we should consider block 23 has higher concentration (0.88) and 12 tons to process. But amount only 6 per period. So same per unit.\\n\\nThus any is fine. But maybe we should choose block 23 (12 to process) because high concentration maybe leads to higher incremental? But per unit change same.\\n\\nLet\\'s compute NPV: If we process block 23, we get 17.99 * 6 = 107.94. That\\'s improvement.\\n\\nBut we might also want to consider that processing block 14 or 15 or 20 yields same incremental NPV. However, block 20 has 21 to process; block 22 only 2. So block 20 might be bigger but limited to 6 per period.\\n\\nThus we can choose any. But we might want to choose block 23 because it has highest concentration. But the per unit change in NPV already is 17.99 for all. That might be because the incremental per ton after discount? But maybe the per unit is same because they all have same processing cost? Not sure.\\n\\nWe should pick one that uses the available 6 tons. Let\\'s pick block 20 maybe? But block 20 has concentration 0.83, but ton to process 21. So maybe high yield. But all same.\\n\\nThus I will choose block 20 to process 6 tons. That will give +107.94 NPV. The new NPV would be 26380.2 + 107.94 = 26488.14.\\n\\nAlternatively, we could process block 23 to get 6*17.99=107.94. Same.\\n\\nWe also might want to consider extraction of 18 if we want to process 18 later. But extraction has negative per ton. So better to process rather than extract. So choose processing action.\\n\\nThus answer: choice 2, block 20, amount 6.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 52681997641, 'load_duration': 167413319, 'prompt_eval_count': 3436, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1052158869, 'eval_count': 2435, 'eval_duration': 42699603010}\n",

Current NPV 26380.2. Possible actions are extraction of blocks 25-36 each 10 units with cost per unit? The cost per unit change in NPV is -1.8 for extraction. But there may be processing later. If we extract, we pay cost of -1.8 per unit, so extraction of 10 units gives -18 NPV. If we process later, each block has processing ton and revenue. For block 33: process ton 50? Actually block 33 has (1.0, 50, 50). Means ore concentration 1.0, ton of block to extract is 50, ton to process 50? Wait from earlier: (block number, ore concentration, ton of block to extract, ton of block to process). So block 33 has ton extract 50, ton process 50. So after extracting all 50 units, we can process 50 units generating revenue. Similarly block 35 has (0.0, 50, 0). No process. block 36 same.

Usually revenue depends on ore concentration times price minus cost. But we don\\'t know price. The per unit change in NPV for extraction is -1.8. So extracting any block 10 units reduces NPV by 18. But we may later process to gain revenue. The processing NPV per unit may be positive for block 33. We don\\'t have that action yet. But we might want to extract 33 to later process for revenue.

Wait block 32 had process 10, so remaining ton to process 40. Actually block 32 was extracted fully (50?) earlier? It had ton to extract 0 after extraction? We did extraction on 33 earlier, not 32. Block 32 had 1.0, 0.0, 10 extracted? Wait initial state: block 32 (1.0,0.0,10) meaning ton to extract 10? Actually block 32: (1.0, 0.0, 10) so ton to extract 10, process 0. Then after processing 32 amount 40 (choice 2) we processed 40 units? Wait block 32 had 10 to extract, but processing 40? That\\'s weird: but earlier we processed 32 40 units which maybe indicates we had already extracted 40? Wait block 32 had process 50 originally? Let\\'s review initial: block 32: (iplina,0.0,10). Actually earlier when we had possible actions after processing 32 40, we had block 32 with ton to extract 0? Actually after that state: block 32 has (1.0,0.0,10). That indicates ton to extract 10, process 10? Wait process 10? It says ton to process 10. So block 32 extraction maybe 40 units extracted previously? Let\\'s step through: Initially block 32 had (1.0,0.0,10). We processed 32 40 (choice 2) but block had 10 extraction? Probably we mis-read. But we can\\'t worry.\\n\\nNow current state: block 32 (1.0, 0.0,10). Means ton to extract 10 still? But we had processed 32 earlier 40, but now extraction shows 10 left. So block 32 still has 10 to extract. So after extraction, we may have process 10 units to process block 32 later? But no processing actions listed: because maybe block 32 has process 10 left but the system hasn\\'t offered processing until extraction done? But we already extracted 40 earlier, maybe the state shows 10 to extract? Hard.\\n\\nBut possible actions list now is only extraction actions. So we must extract somewhere. Which extraction block? We need to consider remaining ton to extract for each block. The list shows extraction actions for blocks 25,26,27,28,29,30,31,34,35,36, all with amount 30. Because earlier block 33 extracted 40 leaving 0 to extract, so removed. So we can choose any of those extraction actions.\\n\\nWe want maximize NPV: all -1.64 per ton, same for all. So choose any. Maybe choose block with highest process NPV? But we need to eventually process. Since extraction cost is negative, but we must extract to process. There\\'s no immediate benefit from extraction now; but we need to extract blocks with high processing NPV later.\\n\\nWhich block has processing opportunity? We have blocks 14,15,18,20,22,23,32.\\n\\nBlock 32 now has 1.0,0.0,10 to extract. We could process after extraction 10. But that will add 16.35 per unit. So eventually we will get processing benefit. But extraction cost -1.64 per unit. So extraction on block 32 will reduce NPV by 16.4 units (approx). But later processing will offset by +16.35 per unit, net ~ -0.02 per unit? Wait extraction cost -1.64 per ton. Processing reward +16.35 per ton. So net per ton = 16.35 -1.64 = 14.71 positive. Good. So we should process those blocks after extraction.\\n\\nSimilarly for blocks 14,15,18,20,22,23. Those have process amount 25,25,33,21,2,6 respectively.\\n\\nBut we currently cannot process them because they are not fully extracted? They have ton to extract 0? Let\\'s check current state: block 14 (0.55,0.0,25). Means ton to extract 0? Actually tuple is (concentration, ton to extract, ton to process). So (0.55,0.0,25) indicates ton to extract 0, process 25. So block 14 is ready for processing. Similarly block 15: (0.51,0.0,25). 18: (0.66,0.0,33). 20: (0.83,0.0,21). 22: (0.85,0.0,2). 23: (0.88,0.0,6). 32: (1.0,0.0,10). Actually block 32 has process 10 still. So many processing actions are still available. But the updated list of possible actions includes only extraction ones, not processing. Wait why? Maybe after each action, we must update list; we processed block 32 earlier, now extraction only. But that seems wrong; maybe due to mis-synchronization of actions after extraction of 33? Let\\'s analyze state at Time_period-19 after last extraction of 33.\\n\\nAfter extraction of 33 amount 40, state shows block 33: (1.0,0.0,50). That means ton to extract 0, process 50. So block 33 fully extracted. That means we cannot process block 33 again? Actually block 33 had extraction 40 previously, leaving 10 to extract? Wait earlier we extracted block 33 40 amount: after extraction state block 33 had (1.0,40,50) meaning ton to extract 40, process 50. Then we processed 32 40. Wait block 32 had (1.0,0.0,10). We processed 32 40, but block 32 didn\\'t have 40 to process. This confusion arises because earlier we processed block 32 40 units even though extraction needed only 10? But the system must have had block 32 originally with extraction 50? Wait earlier initial state had block 32: (1.0,0.0,10). Actually maybe extraction ton and process ton are independent; you can process more than extraction? That would be weird.\\n\\nBut maybe the values represent ton to extract and ton to process left to do, not the amount that remains to be extracted. So block 32 had 10 left to extract. We processed 40 units of block 32? That suggests we incorrectly processed. But maybe the system is wrong.\\n\\nHowever the possible actions now only include extraction; no processing. So perhaps after processing 32 earlier, we cannot process any block? But there are still blocks with process left: 14,15,18,20,22,23,32? But block 32 had process 10 after extraction, now we did processing 40 on it, leaving 10 left to process? Wait block 32 now shows (1.0,0.0,10). That means ton to extract 0, process 10 left. That means we haven\\'t processed block 32 yet? Wait we processed 32 40 earlier, but now block 32 shows process 10. So maybe earlier we extracted 40 from block 32? Actually maybe the extraction action on block 32 40 earlier was extraction: we extracted 40 from block 32, but block 32 had ton to extract 10? Inconsistent.\\n\\nMaybe there\\'s confusion in data. But regardless, the current list only offers extraction actions. We must pick one. We want to maximize NPV: all extraction same -1.64, so any yields same. We may consider strategic selection to leave the highest processing potential block (like block 14,15,18,20,22,23,32) for processing soon. Since extraction of block 32 may leave it ready for processing later. But block 32 currently has 10 to extract, but we have chosen not to process it further now.\\n\\nGiven we want to increase NPV, we need to eventually process those blocks. But since all extraction options have equal cost, we might choose to extract a block that is necessary for future processing but maybe has lower future processing? Actually we might want to preserve some extraction capacity for processing of block 32 later? Wait block 32\\'s processing potential is high but we already processed it? Actually we haven\\'t processed block 32 yet because block 32 had process 10 remaining after extraction. Wait earlier we processed block 32 40, but block 32\\'s extract ton was 0? This is confusing.\\n\\nGiven the list only contains extraction actions with -1.64, no processing. We might want to choose an extraction that leaves us able to process soon, e.g., block 32 has 10 to extract and 10 to process? Actually after extraction of 32 40 earlier, block 32 shows (1.0,0.0,10). So extraction 0 left, process 10 left. So block 32 still needs to be processed 10. That means there should be a processing action available for block 32. But it\\'s not in list. Why? Maybe because extraction and processing actions are separate, but after extraction of 32, processing is still possible. However possible actions list includes only choice 1 (extraction). So perhaps the simulation step hasn\\'t generated processing actions yet. Maybe because processing actions are only generated after extraction of the block? But we processed 32 earlier, so maybe it\\'s not generating processing actions until some period later. But we cannot choose processing now.\\n\\nThus we must pick extraction action. Since all extraction actions have equal NPV, we can choose any. But we might want to choose block with lower ton to process left to keep more processing later? Actually we can choose block 34 or 35 or 36 etc. But we might want to choose block 34 or 35 or 36 which have ton to extract 30 (after earlier 30). Wait extraction actions list: (1,25,30...), up to block 36. All extraction actions have ton to extract 30 (except block 31 has 30 too). All -1.64 per unit. So any will reduce NPV by 30*1.64=49.2 units.\\n\\nBut maybe we want to choose block with the lowest cost to process later? But extraction cost same. But we want to preserve processing capacity of other blocks? No.\\n\\nMaybe we want to extract block 31? But we need to consider future processing. All blocks have processing potential after extraction: 14,15,18,20,22,23,32. Also block 33 after extraction? We have extracted 40 from block 33, gwir. But block 33 now shows (1.0,0.0,50). So we haven\\'t processed it. That means block 33 still has 50 to process left. So we can process it later.\\n\\nThus extraction of block 33 now would not reduce processing opportunity. But block 33 is already fully extracted. So no further extraction.\\n\\nThus we may choose any extraction; perhaps choose block 31? Wait block 31 has 30 extraction left, process 30. But block 31 is not in list? Yes block 31 extraction is listed: (1,31,30). That means after extraction 30, block 31: (1.0,0.0,30). So block 31 ready for processing.\\n\\nThus we might want to extract blocks with high process potential as soon as possible to get processing benefit. But since we have no processing actions now, we can\\'t process them. But after we pick extraction of some block, the next period may provide processing actions for those blocks. But if we pick any extraction, we will eventually get the same processing opportunities. So any extraction yields same future net benefit.\\n\\nThus choose any block arbitrarily. But maybe choose block 34 because its concentration 0.71 is lower than others? Actually extraction cost same across all.\\n\\nThus we pick block 25 as extraction action: (1,25,30). That will reduce NPV by 49.2.\\n\\nThus answer: \"extract 25 with 30\".\\n\\nBut the question: \"What action should be taken next to increase NPV?\" So answer: \"extract any block; choose for example block 25\".\\n\\nThus output: \"extract 25\" maybe? Actually must specify action: \"extract 25\". In context: \"extraction action 1 on block 25, 30 units\" maybe.\\n\\nBut the system may want us to specify \"extraction 25\". I\\'ll answer: \"Extract block 25 (cost -1.64 per ton).\".\\n\\nBut maybe they want a specific block: 25. So I\\'ll answer: \"extract block 25\".\\n\\nAlternatively, we might want to extract block 34? But 34 also same.\\n\\nThus I\\'ll answer: \"extract block 25\".\\n\\nLet\\'s answer accordingly.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 52709869838, 'load_duration': 161442380, 'prompt_eval_count': 3810, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1157598410, 'eval_count': 2886, 'eval_duration': 50301119732}\n",

We see for block 32, block 33 etc. But block 26 has no processing revenue in current state? In mine state, block 26 has 0.0 ore concentration, 0 ton process. So processing would yield nothing.

Wait, the possible actions list only includes extraction for blocks 26,27,28,29,30,31,34,35,36. So cannot process those yet. But block 26 is the only one we can extract. So we need to extract some amount. Since per unit cost is constant, NPV decreases with amount. But we might want to reduce extraction to minimal to preserve future processing? But block 26 has no processing value. So we can extract all to avoid future costs? Since we must not keep extraction amount zero. But we might extract minimal to avoid decreasing NPV too much? But the objective is to maximize NPV over periods; we can later choose to process block 32 or 33 after extraction. But we are not forced to process them now. However we might want to wait to extract them when we have better times? But we cannot process them until we extract them. But extraction cost is -1.49 per unit. There\\'s no better cost later. So we should extract them all eventually, but maybe do it in later periods. But we might be able to extract them gradually. For now we choose 1 unit to keep NPV high. But is there a rule that extractionsmouth can\\'t be less than full ton? Usually extraction can be any positive integer. So we can extract 1 unit of 26.\\n\\nBut we must also consider that extraction actions for 27-31 etc also have same cost, but if we extract any, we will reduce NPV further. So to maximize NPV now, we should extract minimal amount (1). But we have already done multiple times. Maybe we should do 1 again? It\\'s always 1 unit each time. But the per unit cost is constant; maybe we can extract 1 more each period until 0 remains? But we could just skip extraction? No cannot. So maybe we want to stop when we reach 0. But the instruction says \"Extraction cannot be 0 amount if possible.\" So each extraction action must extract >0 until the block is fully extracted? It might allow to extract 1 unit each period until finished. But the NPV would gradually drop.\\n\\nBut maybe we should extract all 49 units at once? But that would reduce NPV by 49*1.49 = 72.99, whereas extracting 1 unit reduces NPV by 1.49. So picking minimal each period might be beneficial if we can eventually finish extraction later. But maybe there are limited periods left? Not specified. But we are asked to \"Choose best action to maximize NPV.\" Since we only have extraction available, we need to pick block 26. The best amount to extract may be minimal? But if we only extract 1 unit, we keep 48 units left, which we might later extract. But at some point we will have to extract the rest, maybe in future periods. So maybe minimal is fine.

After we finish extracting block 26, we might process it next? But block 26 has ore concentration 0.0 so processing gives nothing? Actually revenue per unit is -1.49 cost. That suggests extraction cost per ton, maybe negative NPV. So maybe we should not extract those blocks? But we might need to extract to unlock processing of other blocks? But the action list only includes extraction, so we should pick बुध? But maybe we can also choose to stop extraction and end? But must pick an action. The only actions available are extraction. All have same cost per ton -1.49. We want to minimize extraction because it\\'s costing NPV. But we must follow rule \"extraction if ton to extract >0.\" Maybe we are forced to extract until all blocks are zero? But we can stop extraction? Not sure.\\n\\nThe question: \"Choose the action that maximizes the NPV of the mine.\" We can choose to extract block 26 or others. But perhaps we can process block 32 or 33 because they have processing ton >0 but currently no extraction? Wait block 32 has 10 to process, but ton of block to extract is 0? Actually block 32: (32,1.0,0,10) meaning ore concentration 1.0, ton extract 0, ton process 10. So we cannot process until extraction is done? But extraction already zero, so we might process. But processing is not in list because maybe we cannot process because we haven\\'t extracted any block? But the rule says after full extraction you will see that it can also be processed. So maybe we need to extract block 26-36 to then process them? But that seems wrong.\\n\\nWait maybe the list of possible actions is dynamic and only shows possible actions for current available blocks. So if block 26 has ton to extract >0, extraction is possible. After we finish extracting it, the block will show as processable. But currently we are only allowed extraction. So we can either choose to extract from block 26 or 27 or etc. All have same cost -1.49. So it\\'s indifferent which we extract; but maybe we want to minimize negative NPV by not extracting if possible? But we must choose an action anyway? The requirement: \"Choose from possible actions.\" We could also choose to stop extraction by not extracting? But there is no \"no action.\" So we must choose an extraction.\\n\\nBut maybe we can process block 14 etc. But no processing actions. So likely the best NPV is achieved by not extracting these negative cost blocks; but we must choose an extraction. The best extraction would be minimal cost? But all extraction have same cost per ton -1.49. So to maximize NPV, we might want to do the minimal possible extraction? We have already extracted one ton from block 26 repeatedly, decreasing the NPV each time by 1.49 per ton. So we have not extracted any other blocks. We might consider extracting some other block with positive ore concentration to get revenue? But no actions available. So maybe we should process block 26? But not in list.\\n\\nThus perhaps the best action is to process block 14 etc. But not available.\\n\\nGiven the list, we must pick extraction of one ton from block 26. It\\'s the only choice. Maybe the next step after extraction we will have processing options. But for now, the best NPV would be to not extract any of these negative-cost blocks. But we must choose one action. We might try to extract from block 27-31 etc. But all are same cost. So choose block 26 because it\\'s first. But maybe we can skip extraction by choosing processing? No processing actions present. So we have to choose extraction.\\n\\nThus we output extraction of block 26, amount 1.\\n\\nBut we might choose block 27 or 28? All same cost. Might as well choose block 26 because it\\'s first and might be processed later. But all are negative NPV. If we want to maximize, we could choose to not extract at all, but the system demands action. So best is to choose minimal extraction? The NPV decreases by 1.49 each extraction. But we already extracted many times. So maybe we should stop and not extract any further? But we must choose an action, but maybe we can choose not to extract any further block and end the simulation? Not allowed.\\n\\nMaybe we can choose to process some block that has ton of block to process >0 and ore concentration >0. But no actions for processing. So maybe we must first finish extracting all these blocks before we can process others? That seems odd. The list likely only includes extraction actions for blocks that are currently available to extract; processing actions will appear after extraction completes for some block. So until extraction is finished, no processing. So we are stuck with these negative-cost extraction actions. But maybe the best action is to stop extraction for all negative-cost blocks and exit simulation? Not possible.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe we should skip extraction and just exit? But no.\\n\\nThus answer: extract block 26, amount 1.\\n\\nLet\\'s output accordingly.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 27364428555, 'load_duration': 163051988, 'prompt_eval_count': 3628, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1116799351, 'eval_count': 1456, 'eval_duration': 25525386999}\n",

We are currently at period 20? The actions available are all extraction actions with negative NPV change: -1.49 per unit? They all have same per unit change, -1.49. All blocks have same ton left. So choosing any extraction reduces NPV, but we must choose an action if possible. But constraint: extraction cannot be 0 amount if possible. So we must choose an extraction action anyway. We can choose any block. Which block to pick? Might consider future processing potential? We have block 26 with 46 remaining. But note: \"After full extraction of block you will see that it can also be processed in the next action.\" So after we extract all 46 from block 26, we can process. But we also have other blocks. But processing would generate revenue. But we are limited to one action per period? Yes. We can choose extraction or processing. We might want to process if possible? But we cannot process until fully extracted?

So currently we still have extraction left on many blocks. All extraction actions have negative NPV change. But we need to do one extraction. Which block to choose? Maybe choose block with smallest ton remaining? But ton difference not affecting NPV change per unit is same. But maybe we want to choose block that will allow future processing with positive NPV? Which block has processing potential? We see blocks with process ton >0: blocks 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 32, 33. Those blocks have processing ton >0. But those blocks are not yet extracted. But we can extract them. But we also have block 26 with 46 ton extraction only, no process. So maybe we want to choose extraction on a block that leads to processing later? The ones with processing potential have some processing ton. But if we fully extract them, we can process. But maybe we want to extract those blocks with high process ton early to start processing. But we cannot process until fully extracted. But we have multiple blocks. However we_PROGRESS to process: blocks 32 and 33 have process ton 10 each. Blocks 14 and 15 have process ton 25 each. Blocks 18 has 33. Block 20 has 21. Block 22 has 2. Block 23 has 6. So maybe we want to extract 26 because it\\'s the only block with ton remaining but no processing potential.

Perhaps we want to do extraction on a block that will be processed in next action with positive NPV. So maybe we choose block 14 or 15? But their process ton 25, so after extraction we process later. But what about the NPV change for extraction of those blocks? It\\'s -1.49 per ton. For block 14, extraction left ton maybe 45? Actually block 14 has ton extraction left 45. That block will later allow processing 25 ton. So maybe extract block 14 now reduces NPV by 1.49, but future processing might give positive NPV? The problem doesn\\'t give per unit change for processing. But we assume processing has positive change. But not given. But we might choose extraction on block 26 now to minimize future negative extraction cost? Because block 26 will remain until fully extracted. But we could also skip block 26 for now and do block 27, etc. All same. So maybe pick block 26 as it\\'s already being extracted sequentially. So we continue extraction on block 26.
